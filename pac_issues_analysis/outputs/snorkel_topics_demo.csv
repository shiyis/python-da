how progressives can win published in 2007. in the acknowledgements section of the book, creamer stated that his political views had been deeply influenced by the legendary community organizer saul alinsky. stand up straight! advanced the notion that the democratic party could win a permanent majority in congress by doing the following passing a national health care bill, thereby turning more people into wards of an everexpanding government, and of the party that works to grow government; and giving amnesty to all illegal immigrants, thereby creating, virtually overnight, a large new constituency of democratic voters. the author conceded that his desire to reshape the structure of onesixth of the american economy i.e., the health care sector was contingent upon the democrats being able to control 60 votes in the u.s. senate, and upon the election of a progressive democrat to the white house conditions that could, in creamers estimation, be achieved by the year 2009. notably, his book was effusive in its praise of thensenator barack obama. creamers book advocated a public plan that would guarantee every u.s. residents right to health care; this plan eventually would serve as a model for the public option in subsequent legislative proposals by congressional democrats. in addition, creamer laid out a progressive agenda for structural change, which included a tenpoint plan to set the stage for implementing universal health care we must create a national consensus that health care is a right, not a commodity; and that government must guarantee that right. we must create a national consensus that the health care system is in crisis. our messaging program over the next two years should focus heavily on reducing the credibility of the health insurance industry and focusing on the failure of private health insurance. we need to systematically forge relationships with large sectors of the businessemployer community. we need to convince political leaders that they owe their elections, at least in part, to the groundswell of support of sic universal health care, and that they face political peril if they fail to deliver on universal health care in 2009. we need not agree in advance on the components of a plan, but we must foster a process that can ultimately yield consensus. over the next two years, we must design and organize a massive national field program. we must focus especially on the mobilization of the labor movement and the faith community. we must systematically leverage the connections and resources of a massive array of institutions and organizations of all types. to be successful, we must put in place commitments for hundreds of millions of dollars to be used to finance paid communications and mobilization once the battle is joined. to win, added creamer, we must not just generate understanding, but emotionfear, revulsion, anger, disgust. beyond the narrow specifics of health care, creamer in his book advocated the democratization of wealth in america and progressive control of governments around the world. creamer also identified immigration as an issue that will have an enormous impact on the battle for power between the progressive and conservative forces in american society. he said if the democrats continue to stand firmly for immigrant rights, the issue will define immigrants voting loyalties for a generation. if we are successful, a gigantic block of progressive votes will enter the electorate over the next 15 yearsa block that could be decisive in the battle for the future. mirroring his approach to health care, creamer stressed the importance of persuading religious leaders to lobby, on moral grounds, in favor of amnesty and expanded rights for illegal aliens. stand up straight! was endorsed by a number of leading democrats and their political allies, including greg galluzzo, director of the gamaliel foundation; seiu president andrew stern, who said the book would hopefully inspire more people to act; political strategist david axelrod, who said it provides a blueprint for future victories; democrat operative john podesta, who called the book a straightup shot in the arm for progressives; political commentator arianna huffington, who said it would help return america to its progressive roots; and congressman john lewis, who said the book would help create our societys next historical movement. in 2008 creamer worked for the obama presidential campaign, training volunteers at camp obama. today creamer writes periodically for the huffington post. on november 19, 2009, he penned a piece that said if we succeed in winning health insurance reform we will have breached the gates of the status quo. we will demonstrate that fundamental change is possible. into that breach will flow a wave of progressive change. on november 24, 2009, creamer attended a white house state dinner along with highlevel obama advisors like andrew stern and david axelrod despite the fact that exconvicts are usually barred from such events. in a december 2009 interview, creamer said the following with regard to senator joseph liebermans objection to governmentrun healthcare the problem with lieberman is .... he has kind of the suicidebomber kind of advantage. he doesnt care if he blows the whole house down. the best option for him, to a healthcare bill, is no bill; thats fine with him. he doesnt care if theres no bill, because the insurance industry is happy to have no bill. and he is happygleeful to try and punish the left wing of the party that he believes wronged him. when the interviewer interjected that lieberman was a vindictive, spiteful, little, miserable man who is taking a lot of money from the insurance industry, creamer said, absolutely miserable.",1225,9,immigration
