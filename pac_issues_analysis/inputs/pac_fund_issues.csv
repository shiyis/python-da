1727,HILL JAMES FRENCH,"over the past four years, americans have read much about vladimir putin and russia and the threat to american elections. putin is a bad actor, and russia as a nuclear power is a distinct and destabilizing force in western europe and the middle east. weve certainly witnessed that in the catastrophic obama foreign policy errors of allowing russian to invade the ukraine, take over and occupy crimea, and become an essential coconspirator in the murder and mayhem occurring in syria. for our part, the united states has passed significant sanctions legislation including the sergei magninsky act, which is named for a moscow accountant killed by putin in a corruption scandal. more than 50 individuals are designated under this law for human rights abuses and corruption. the success of this law being used against russia is one reason i supported the global magnitsky human rights and accountability act in the 114th congress. this bill applied the same sanctions penalties for human rights abuses and corruption across the globe. further, the trump administration has levied sanctions against sectors of the russian economy and key russians in the russian federation. the united states has imposed sanctions related to the russian invasion of ukraine to nearly 700 individuals through the countering russian influence in europe and eurasia act, which i supported in 2017. we have also sanctioned russian officials and the russian intelligence agency for its malicious cyber activities, including interference in u.s. elections. we also have sanctioned russia for propping up illegitimate and dictatorial regimes in syria and venezuela. the economic pressure that the united states is putting on russia today is significant. given all that, its essential that you understand that although russia is one of the largest physical countries in the world occupying some 6.6 square million miles of territory, it remains a commoditydependent, vulnerable country. likewise russia has a gdp that is roughly the same as spain, which has a third the population, and a per capita gdp a quarter of germany, which has half the population. moreover, the country is a demographic basket case with low life expectancy of age 66 for men and low birth rates.1 and, analysts expect that by 2040 the russian national population will shrink below 120 million compared to 141.7 million today with ethnic russians actually being only a tiny majority. this economic insecurity, increased global isolation, and demographic chaos accounts for putins extreme aggression and intimidation of the border states that made up the former soviet union. i believe the goals for any future relationship between the united states and russia should include",430

1829,HUDSON HALE MICHELLE R,"by richard hudson for congress on 9 january 2017 in news rep. richard hudson were going to repeal obamacare theres no disagreement among republicans that were going to repeal obamacare. those are the words of rep. richard hudson rnc 08 in an exclusive appearance on the what matters in north carolina podcast on january 5, 2016. during the interview, hudson affirmed that the mood among his colleagues is in fact that repealing the monstrosity officially known as the affordable care act is a priority. hudson continued, of course saying that obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced is just the starting point, but hudson said it is a conversation that house speaker paul ryan rwisconsin and presidentelect donald trump began to have immediately following the election in november. there are procedural questions and issues that will have to be navigated in order to undo a law that has been in place for nearly seven years. hudson said, right now its a matter of timing and sequence. what youll see is a bill move very quickly through the house and senate to repeal obamacare, using a budget process called reconciliation. this is a process that allows a vote that cant be filibustered in the senate, so 51 votes can pass it. a similar bill was sent to president obama last year which he vetoed. hudson said that the senate will likely start the process with their bill next week, and that a bill could be on president trumps desk in february. but, the process is not as cut and dry as it may seem. hudson said that because of senate rules attached to budget reconciliation bills, a repeal and full replacement of obamacare cannot be done in the same legislation. hudson said that there could be some replacement language in the form of expanding health savings accounts. however, the tax penalties which have been so onerous to many americans may be addressed in the repeal bill. hudson said, my hope is that youll see a zeroing out of those tax penalties. additionally, hudson said that president trump is set to begin unwinding obamacare. hudson said, vicepresidentelect mike pence spoke to house republicans yesterday, wednesday, january 4, 2016, and he told us that president trump is going to start immediately through the executive order process, through the administrative process of replacing obamacare and doing the things they can do. for example, having an hhs secretary remove some of the restrictions on insurance companies on plans, some of the requirements they can do administratively, theyll start that right away, as well. hudson, who serves on the house energy commerce committee, said that the committee will start hearing before the end of the month on what a replacement to obamacare will look like. hudson said that hr 2300, which has been introduced the past three years is the basic blueprint for what replacement will look like. hudson said, the basic components of it are, health savings accounts, allowing insurance companies to compete across state lines, giving tax credits to individuals who buy insurance, transparency of cost so that you know what things cost before you go have a procedure, tort reform. these are all the things well be doing and theyll probably start as individual legislation. pulling the rug out from under a massive law like the affordable care act is ultimately not going to happen, as hudson noted that the repeal that is likely to be on trumps desk in february will be a phasedin two or threeyear repeal. hudson said, as mike pence said yesterday, we need to make sure we have an orderly transition so that we dont disrupt markets, so that we dont disrupt families. if there are folks out there that have health care through obamacare they dont need to have anxiety that theyre going to lose that coverage. hudson added, there will be a time period that we will have to put that new health care reform in place, before obamacare goes away. but, obamacare will be eliminated with that legislation thats going to pass next month. ultimately hudson said that they want to get it right, and have real conservative healthcare reform that will help people. click here to listen to the full interview on what matters in north carolina with rep. richard hudson, including his thoughts on the bill he filed on national concealed carry reciprocity.",731
1830,HUDSON HALE MICHELLE R,"by richard hudson for congress on 9 december 2019 in news gerrymandering decision will mean new harnett representative the political tug of war over gerrymandering of congressional districts was settled on dec. 2 by a north carolina appeals court decision that leaves congressional districts as they were drawn by the republicanled state legislature. that means a change for voters in most of harnett, parts of johnston, lee, moore and all of cabarrus, stanly, montgomery and cumberland counties, who now makeup the 8th u.s. congressional district. it also means a new face will be representing most of those voters in washington, d.c. current 8th district congressman richard hudson, who officially filed to regain his seat shortly after the new districts were declared valid, visited dunn recently in an effort to bring awareness to residents of the pending changes to their representation. hudson has served as the representative for the district since 2013. my philosophy is if im youre a congressman, i need to know you and you need to know me, hudson said. so, i got here as soon as i could. voters will have a bit of a foggy path to travel until the changes take effect. while voters in the redrawn 8th district will choose their representative in the 2020 primary and general elections, the candidates chosen and eventually elected, wont actually represent the new district until it becomes official in january of 2021. im going to represent my old district until january 3, 2021, hudson said. ill be campaigning here, but if you need help with the federal government, im not legally allowed to help you until then. its going to be confusing for people because theyre going to see my ads and my signs thinking they can come to me, but im not really allowed to help them. but i can help direct people and we wont turn anybody away. hudson defines himself as a conservative, but common sense person who likes to get things done. he is ranked as the 12th most conservative member of the house by the national journal, he also carries another distinction according to one survey that dubbed him the most effective north carolina congressman. the university of virginia and vanderbilt university did a study on the subject and hudson was rated as most effective among all republicans and democrats in the state. i think i demonstrate you can stand on principle, he said. but you can also reach across the aisle and get things done for the people. among his duties in the house, hudson serves on the energy and commerce committee as well as on subcommittees for health care, energy and digital privacy. as far as a primary focus currently, hudson says veterans and the military are high on his list. fort bragg sits in the heart of his district. that fact, combined with the large number of veterans who have made north carolina their home, has made hudson want to focus on them and the issues concerning them, he says. we probably have more veterans in this part of the country than anywhere, he said. then, i represent the largest army base in the world, fort bragg, the epicenter of the universe, and thats a big priority for me making sure were giving those men and women everything they need to do their jobs well, get home safely and also take care of their families. hudson spoke on the latest efforts by the house to pass a needed spending bill. he noted a continuing resolution, which allowed spending to continue temporarily at current levels, was recently passed. that handcuffs the military, though, and doesnt afford them the chance to start new programs or get needed funding increases, he said. it expires on dec. 20. when we do continuing resolutions, in which we say keep spending at the same levels as last year, its devastating to the military, hudson said. they cant start new programs, they cant buy new systems. its really bad news for our troops. hudson said the largest obstacle to get a new spending bill passed comes in the ongoing argument between democrats and republicans over funding president donald trumps border wall. he said the stalemate has led to a lack of negotiation between the two sides. the biggest sticking point is the democrats in washington refuse to give the president any money for the border wall, hudson said. and if theres no wiggle room there, theres no negotiations. i dont know how you get out of that. he quotes former north carolina senator jesse helms when speaking about the matter. at the end of the day youve got to compromise, he said. as senator jesse helms, one of my heroes, used to say i wont compromise my principles, but i will compromise my preferences and at the end of the day youve got to be willing to compromise some of your preferences and come back and fight for more later. hudson says the ongoing impeachment inquiry by democrats is hindering efforts to resolve other issues, just as important, if not more. he says the focus is preventing getting anything done. theyre so focused on that, were not getting things done like funding the government, hudson said. theres a lot of things we can agree on like funding infrastructure, like dealing with drug pricing. theres so many things that we could be doing that democrats and republicans can agree on that the people here expect us to be doing, and thats the frustration for me. after filing for reelection on dec. 2, hudson released a statement. im running for reelection to continue to be a conservative, common sense voice for the people of north carolinas 8th district, hudson said. ive always been clear on my priorities for the district creating an environment where folks can find goodpaying jobs, rebuilding our military and being a voice for our veterans. i look forward to continuing to share our positive message from cumberland to cabarrus and everywhere in between. click here for the original article.",1005

2598,MENSING DALE KENNETH,"by dennis l. cuddy, ph.d. march 2, 2015 newswithviews.com there is a great controversy today over the current educational reform movement known as common core cc. many people have offered specific criticisms of the movement, but they generally look at cc in isolation. however, it is important to understand the back ground of cc, and a good starting point for that begins with the illuminati, which began on may 1, 1776. the fundamental purpose of the illuminati was to do away with existing authority e.g., monarchical, religious, etc. and adopt the principle of its founder, adam weishaupt, which was that they, the illuminati or enlightened, knew what was best for people. the leaders of cc today also believe they know, even better than parents, what is best in education for children in the united states. relevant to education, certain members of the illuminati became tutors to princes, who would then become czars, kings, etc. e.g., alexander i of russia and be under the influence of the illuminati. in terms of what we know today as elementary and secondary education, illuminati member johann heinrich pestalozzi a swiss, codenamed alfred had the greatest influence. according to will monroes history of the pestalozzian method in the united states 1907, the educational ideas of pestalozzi began to be printed in journals and textbooks in the united states in 1806. they began to be used in some school systems, especially in new england where they were viewed favorably be the intelligentsia of horace manns day. this was the first half of the 1800s, and mann became known as the father of the american public education. utopian socialist robert owen visited pestalozzi at yverdon, switzerland in 1818, and applied the illuminists educational principles in britain and america. in 1825, owen established the first commune in the united states in new harmony, indiana. joining owen in 1828 was frances wright formerly madame francoise darusmont from france who, with owens son robert dale owen and orestes brownson, formed the workingmens party in new york. according to a concise history of the american republic vol. 1 by samuel morison, henry steele commager, and william leuchtenburg, frances wright became a lectureplatform apostle of...a system which she called national, rational, republican education, free for all, at the expense of all, conducted under the guardianship of the state, apart from the contaminating influence of parents. after brownson became a christian, he revealed in the works of orestes brownson 20 volumes that their plan in establishing their political party was as follows the great object was to get rid of christianity, and to convert our churches into halls of science. the plan was not to make open attacks upon religion, although we might belabor the clergy and bring them into contempt where we could; but to establish a system of statewe said nationalschools, from which all religion was to be excluded, in which nothing was to be taught except such knowledge as is verifiable by the senses, and to which all parents were to be compelled by law to send their children. our complete plan was to take the children from their parents at the age of 12 or 18 months, and to have them nursed, fed, clothed, and trained in these schools at the public expense; but at any rate, we were to have godless schools for all the children of the country....the plan has been successfully pursued...,and the whole action of the country on the subject has taken the direction we sought to give it. one of the principal movers of the scheme had no mean share in organizing the smithsonian institute.",601

agreement with microsoft to develop a master curriculum which has become the foundation of common core. according to dennis l. cuddy ph.d., gates initialed every page and agreed that this curriculum was to reflect unescos values. these values were explained in first unesco directorgeneral julian huxleys unesco its purpose and its philosophy as including a scientific world humanism, global in extent and evolutionary in backgroundmay,11,2015 newswithviews.com. such a scientific world humanism has found its grand standard bearer in john dewey, whos influence has done much to establish a receptive audience for marxism in the youth of america. common core curriculum is statist. the monitoring of the students is overtly orwellian. the federal purpose of common core is to arrange students to be able to participate in an arranged global production system outcomesperformance based education, reflecting the 1985 geneva summits u.s.ussr education exchange agreement. common core standards and tactics are an effort to eliminate the american spirit of courageous individuality, free thinking and vibrant selfdetermination. rather than being debased by the influence of unesco, our schools need to teach with the purpose of helping students understand and achieve their inherent roll in the working out of liberty. the third primary process for miseducation is the liberal and the neoconservative applications of the principles of trotskys, fourth international. the objective of the fourth international is to eventuate socialism in various countries, especially the united states, with the ultimate goal of world communism. leon trotsky wrote, despite all the defeats of the proletariat, the position of the class enemy remains a hopeless one. capitalism is doomed. only in the socialist revolution is there salvation for mankind. open letter for the fourth international, first published new militant new york, august 3, 1935. translated new militant. the founding of the neoconservative movement involved the embracing of the communist philosophies of leon trotsky. irving kristol, regarded as the godfather of neoconservatism was a trotskyite in 1940 and became an avid proponent of statist, centralized government. basic trotskyite financing and basic neoconsevative financing come from related elitist globalists. an example of this globalist financing is the use of elihu root, the founding chairman of the council on foreign relations, to facilitate the financing of trotskys bolsheviks. another demonstration of globalist financing of socialism comes from anthony sutton. in his, wall street and the bolshevik revolution, sutton wrote of top tier financier andrew carnegies financing of the marburg plan. this was a plan in which the worlds governments would become communist, while the ultimate power would actually be in the hands of the wall street types to control its councils and enforce peace and so provide a specific for all the political ills of mankind. in his, history of the jews in the soviet union, alexander isayavivh solzhenitsyn points to the amoral logic of this long and consistent relationship between wall street and socialism. carnegies involvement in the marburg plan was only a part of his seminal and singularly wide efforts toward miseducating the american youth toward a scientific world humanism communism. the fact that the archglobalist bechtel corporation financed ronald reagans winning bid for the presidency, demonstrates president reagans actual neoconservative colors. his neoconservative affiliations explain his being an accomplice to the aforementioned 1985 u.s.ussr education exchange agreement, which has helped to quietly circumvent the wests supposed victory in the cold war. globalist george pratt schultz negotiated the u.s.ussr education exchange agreement. please note that george pratt schultz secretary of state, caspar weinberger secretary of defense, william casey director of the central intelligence agency , and kenneth davis deputy secretary of energy were all with bechtel before they became part of the reagan administration. truly, the most influential individuals within congress support the neoconservative ideas of centralized, elitist, anticonstitutional government that fosters a reinforcement of all things new world order. this includes going along with nafta, the patriot act, the two invasions of iraq the first invasion of iraq was a united nations police action, and strongly supporting communist common core education. the multiple facets of agenda 21, such as smart growth, governmentprivate partnerships such as iclei international council on local environmental initiatives and william clintons, presidents council on sustainable development are all globalist concepts supported and perpetuated by neoconservatives. these concepts are also integral to the goals of the neoconservatives liberal, counterparts the leaders of the democratic party. regarding the democratic party, i respectfully suggest to the reader that they study the relationship between franklin d. roosevelts vicepresident, henry wallace, and the communist cell of harrold ware. when the neoconservative president george w. bush chose to promote the statist, no child left behind education debacle, he appointed the liberal senator ted kennedy to work out the details. it was liberal president barack obama who pushed the states to administer common core miseducation. the attempts to greatly reduce the power of the states, the implementing of the purpose and philosophy of unesco, and the applying of the principles of trotskys fourth international are three processes embraced by essentially the same people. if they like one of these processes, then they like the other two. they are a breed that seeks to objectify everyone but their own ruling class. statists, unesco, the neoconservatives and the liberal democratic leaders understand that the essential first step toward implementing communism is the miseducation of youth. by way of their scheming, federalized education is the weed from which slavery is to be propagated. we must show courage! liberty requires the kind of education that only courage can bring. as your congressman, i will ever seek to eliminate common core and the department of education. i will continue to advocate the united states withdrawal from

2613,MENSING DALE KENNETH,"because the east bay area has so many people, they cajole themselves into feeling that it is okay to take advantage of the less populated north country. they think it is logical to take the north countrys water to solve their problems even if it creates problems in the north. not the least of these problems is the effect on the norths tourist industry. here is an idea if the east bay area needs more water, why dont they start desalinization projects like san diego and arabia? or, try covering the canals with solar panels to reduce evaporation like they do in india. the electricity from these panels could be used to power desalinization. they could construct a variety of types and systems of water storage. basically, they should find ways to solve their problems with investment and innovation rather than just taking the norths water. the central valley water project, which takes trinity county water, was established in 1933 for the purpose of providing water for agriculture. it will now use trinity water to augment the delta ecosystem rather than for valley agriculture. it just so happens that the north country has an ecosystem too. as your congressman, i will work to defend the norths water. the forest service has changed. the root of the change is philosophical. in response to a variety of forces such as economics, culture, and agenda 21, the forest service has come to regard the forest as an ecosystem to be maintained through their ideas of protection. this philosophy includes the idea that underbrush should be left to the whims of nature, including potential fire. however, when fire occurs, we must fight the whims of nature. their philosophy is exercised at the expense of multiple use needs. i strongly embrace the idea of having and protecting primitive areas like the trinity alps, the yolla bolly wilderness and the marble mountains. but, we also have a new wilderness. people live in and around national forests and their use of the land needs to reflect the fact that the forest can be used but not exploited. one of the primary problems that the north country faces is forest fires. it is clear that forest fire size, intensity, amount of smoke and financial cost are all very much exacerbated by the fact that underbrush is not cleared. good logging companies used to do this work as part of their responsibilities in harvesting. these forest fires obviously create much destruction and smoke. many of our leaders regularly express concern about the need to take various actions to curb air pollution. i find forest fire smoke to be on a par with auto and industrial exhaust. smoke is bad for the health and comfort of our citizens. and, smoke and charred forests certainly discourage tourism. we can not go back in time. the new wilderness of today needs to be cared for in such a way that all valid interests are taken into consideration. citizens who wish to work can be employed to clear underbrush and reverse riparian damage. they can be paid to do this using funds that are currently allocated for food stamps or other government programs. the california conservation corps could be expanded to provide such employment. there is much, much less financial cost in preventing fire than there is in fighting fire.",557
2614,MENSING DALE KENNETH,"the first primary process for miseducation is the attempts to greatly reduce the power of the state. the power of the state is a key element of the american system that brought about freedom in the first place. true freedom of thought persists because of absence of centralization. each of the colonies had a different approach to life, and therefor there were at least thirteen different approaches to education. being part of the british empire demonstrated to the colonists that a distant central authority breeds captivity, objectification, and dependence. of course, some centralization is necessary to the union. yet, education by experience revealed to the colonists, the patriots and the framers that too much centralization is very bad for freedom. much of the answer to the potential problems of overcentralization is found in the tenth amendment the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. as the idea of education is not found in the constitution, education is reserved to the states or the people. of course, for several arenas elemental to everyday life, such as education, the tenth amendment is a vital hallmark of freedom. so, the liberal hates the tenth amendment. the attempt to eliminate the power of the states and the power of people is called statism. defining the term, statist, dictionary.com says, the principle or policy of concentrating extensive economic, political, and related controls in the state state meaning federal or national government at the cost of individual liberty. in order to eliminate the power of the states or the people, the federal government overtaxes the individual. this overtaxing removes potential resources for education from families, school districts, counties, and states. in order to retrieve some of the tax money, these debilitated groups, then, generally allow themselves to be bribed by the federal government. the money comes back with very serious strings attached. prominent among the strings attached to federal education money is the insistence that communist ideas must be taught and applied. such ideas include assertions or implications that it is wrong for a law abiding citizen to own a gun, the idea that freedom of religion means freedom from religion, the idea that the federal government has the final word on curriculum and teaching strategies, and the idea that the main purpose of education is to prepare a person to be a productive functionary in a global economy. among many other things, the statist way of thinking brought about ronald reagans signing of the u.s.ussr education exchange agreement in geneva in 1985. the statist way of thinking also brought about senate bill s.1177, the every student succeeds act, which became public law no 11495 on 12102015. both of these federal actions provide templates for communist indoctrination of the students in the public schools of the united states.",482
2615,MENSING DALE KENNETH,"in 1972, unescos bestseller learning to be the world of education today and tomorrow was published. in this editor work, the authors say they are in search of a new educational order...based on scientific and technological training, one of the essential components of scientific humanism. the book also emphasized relativity and dialectical thought, and proclaimed that ...an individual should avoid systematically setting up his beliefs and convictions...his behavior and customs as models or rules valid for all times. note the situation in baltimore looks like the alinsky model. hillary clinton wrote her senior thesis at wellesley college on saul alinsky, and barack obama became a community organizer as a follower of alinsky. there is an acknowledgement to lucifer at the front of alinskys rules for radicals, and in that book, alinsky says the community organizer should rub raw the resentments of the community and fan the latent hostilities. isnt that what occurred in baltimore? in the early 1970s, michael lerner who would become an important adviser to hillary clinton authored the new socialist revolution, in which he proclaimed education will be radically transformed in our socialist community...the main emphasis will be on learning how to... live and work collectively....the next level is learning some series of skills, for ones first set of jobs. and in vladimir turchenkos the scientific and technological revolution and the revolution in education 1976 imported into the united states is described linking instruction with productive labor this is similar to plank 10 of the communist manifesto mentioned earlier. the year after turchenkos book appears in the united states, on november 17, 1977 u.s. assistant secretary of education mary berry delivered an address, the chinese experience in education what america stands to learn, at the university of illinois. she revealed that the u.s. office of education was developing lifelong learning programs modeled after the communist chinese programs. two years later, the u.s. department of education usdoe was established under president jimmy carter, fulfilling a promise he had made to the nea. in 1980, ronald reagan was elected president, taking office in january 1981. over the next several years, carter administration holdovers left the national institute of education within usdoe. one of them, marc tucker an nie associate director went to the newly established early 1985 carnegie forum on education and the economy cfee. this was after north carolina governor jim hunt had written an article in phi delta kappan fall 1984 advising linking education and the economy, and he suggested to david hamburg carnegie foundation ceo that he fund a cfe and hunt became vicechairman. the year after cfee was begun, mike cohen left nie in 1986 and went to the national governors association nga. about the same time, ramsey selden who had opposed our efforts to have more intensive systematic phonics taught in schools left nie and went to the council of chief state school officers ccsso as one of their lead education personnel. the nga of which hunt has been a chairman and ccsso would eventually be the lead organizations promoting common core. in the winter 198788 edition of action in teacher education, professors martin haberman and james collins wrote in the future of the teaching profession that schooling is now seen primarily as job training and, for this reason, quite comparable to schooling in nondemocratic societies. once education is redefined as a personal good and as emphasizing preparation for the world of work as its first purpose, our schools can appropriately be compared with those of the ussr. at the same time as habermans and collins article appeared, the cfee changed its name to the national center on education and the economy ncee with board members including david rockefeller, jr. and hillary clinton. early in 1989, ncee produced to secure our future the federal role in education, which would play an important role in framing the issues and shaping the agreements that would be made at the education summit held at the university of virginia charlottesville in september 1989. george h.w. bush skull bones member elected president in november 1988 and the governors of the 50 states met at the summit and agreed to establish national education goals. even though president bush was a republican and had many republican governors from whom to choose, he selected gov. bill clinton rhodes scholar to head the initial work. this is an example of how the power elite manages both the political left and right. following the summit, the nga would ask members of ncees staff to assist in the development of national education goals 6 but later 8. this process would culminate in the announcement of national education goals by president george h.w. bush in his january 31,1990 state of the union address.",787
2616,MENSING DALE KENNETH,"creamer identified immigration as an issue that will have an enormous impact on the battle for power between the progressive and conservative forces in american society. he said if the democrats continue to stand firmly for immigrant rights, the issue will define immigrants voting loyalties for a generation. if we are successful, a gigantic block of progressive votes will enter the electorate over the next 15 yearsa block that could be decisive in the battle for the future. mirroring his approach to health care, creamer stressed the importance of persuading religious leaders to lobby, on moral grounds, in favor of amnesty and expanded rights for illegal aliens. born in 1948, robert creamer is the husband of democrat rep. jan schakowsky. he formerly served as executive director of the illinois public action fund where his wife was the program director, and subsequently as a leader of citizen actionillinois. he was also a lobbyist for george soross open society institute. today creamer heads the strategic consulting group, a political consultancy whose list of clients includes acorn, the service employees international union seiu, the aflcio, the united steelworkers union of america, the democratic congressional campaign committee, and dozens of other leftist or democratic party state organizations. pursuant to an fbi investigation, creamer in 2006 was indicted for bank fraud and tax evasion. during his trial, he received some 200 letters of support from such notables as richard durbin, carol browner, jesse jackson, and david axelrod. creamer ultimately was sentenced to five months in federal prison plus eleven months of house arrest. upon his sentencing, he publicly pledged for the rest of my life i will continue to do whatever i can to work for social and economic justice. while incarcerated or on forced sabbatical, as he called it creamer wrote a 628page political manual titled stand up straight! how progressives can win published in 2007. in the acknowledgements section of the book, creamer stated that his political views had been deeply influenced by the legendary community organizer saul alinsky. stand up straight! advanced the notion that the democratic party could win a permanent majority in congress by doing the following passing a national health care bill, thereby turning more people into wards of an everexpanding government, and of the party that works to grow government; and giving amnesty to all illegal immigrants, thereby creating, virtually overnight, a large new constituency of democratic voters. the author conceded that his desire to reshape the structure of onesixth of the american economy i.e., the health care sector was contingent upon the democrats being able to control 60 votes in the u.s. senate, and upon the election of a progressive democrat to the white house conditions that could, in creamers estimation, be achieved by the year 2009. notably, his book was effusive in its praise of thensenator barack obama. creamers book advocated a public plan that would guarantee every u.s. residents right to health care; this plan eventually would serve as a model for the public option in subsequent legislative proposals by congressional democrats. in addition, creamer laid out a progressive agenda for structural change, which included a tenpoint plan to set the stage for implementing universal health care we must create a national consensus that health care is a right, not a commodity; and that government must guarantee that right. we must create a national consensus that the health care system is in crisis. our messaging program over the next two years should focus heavily on reducing the credibility of the health insurance industry and focusing on the failure of private health insurance. we need to systematically forge relationships with large sectors of the businessemployer community. we need to convince political leaders that they owe their elections, at least in part, to the groundswell of support of sic universal health care, and that they face political peril if they fail to deliver on universal health care in 2009. we need not agree in advance on the components of a plan, but we must foster a process that can ultimately yield consensus. over the next two years, we must design and organize a massive national field program. we must focus especially on the mobilization of the labor movement and the faith community. we must systematically leverage the connections and resources of a massive array of institutions and organizations of all types. to be successful, we must put in place commitments for hundreds of millions of dollars to be used to finance paid communications and mobilization once the battle is joined. to win, added creamer, we must not just generate understanding, but emotionfear, revulsion, anger, disgust. beyond the narrow specifics of health care, creamer in his book advocated the democratization of wealth in america and progressive control of governments around the world. creamer also identified immigration as an issue that will have an enormous impact on the battle for power between the progressive and conservative forces in american society. he said if the democrats continue to stand firmly for immigrant rights, the issue will define immigrants voting loyalties for a generation. if we are successful, a gigantic block of progressive votes will enter the electorate over the next 15 yearsa block that could be decisive in the battle for the future. mirroring his approach to health care, creamer stressed the importance of persuading religious leaders to lobby, on moral grounds, in favor of amnesty and expanded rights for illegal aliens. stand up straight! was endorsed by a number of leading democrats and their political allies, including greg galluzzo, director of the gamaliel foundation; seiu president andrew stern, who said the book would hopefully inspire more people to act; political strategist david axelrod, who said it provides a blueprint for future victories; democrat operative john podesta, who called the book a straightup shot in the arm for progressives; political commentator arianna huffington, who said it would help return america to its progressive roots; and congressman john lewis, who said the book would help create our societys next historical movement. in 2008 creamer worked for the obama presidential campaign, training volunteers at camp obama. today creamer writes periodically for the huffington post. on november 19, 2009, he penned a piece that said if we succeed in winning health insurance reform we will have breached the gates of the status quo. we will demonstrate that fundamental change is possible. into that breach will flow a wave of progressive change. on november 24, 2009, creamer attended a white house state dinner along with highlevel obama advisors like andrew stern and david axelrod despite the fact that exconvicts are usually barred from such events. in a december 2009 interview, creamer said the following with regard to senator joseph liebermans objection to governmentrun healthcare the problem with lieberman is .... he has kind of the suicidebomber kind of advantage. he doesnt care if he blows the whole house down. the best option for him, to a healthcare bill, is no bill; thats fine with him. he doesnt care if theres no bill, because the insurance industry is happy to have no bill. and he is happygleeful to try and punish the left wing of the party that he believes wronged him. when the interviewer interjected that lieberman was a vindictive, spiteful, little, miserable man who is taking a lot of money from the insurance industry, creamer said, absolutely miserable.",1225

2622,MENSING DALE KENNETH,"everything about the law is falsehood. the tenth amendment was intended to prevent repeating the likes of king george iii. the tenth amendment was intended to prevent the likes of the affordable care act. in order to justify their usurping of the tenth amendment, the leaders of the progressives have resorted to the commerce clause, which is found in the third paragraph of section 8 of the first article of the constitution, and indicates that congress shall have the power to regulate commerce among the several states. the method of regulating commerce is found in paragraph 18, and provides that congress may make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution such regulation of commerce. i feel very strongly that regulating commerce does not mean usurping and dominating commerce. and, i feel that, necessary and proper are just the opposite of the affordable care act. the affordable care act is a culmination of ideas which together assert the concept that the government knows best, does best and has the right to lie, cheat and connive because the end justifies the means. in order to understand this outlook, may i suggest that you consult president obamas playbook. the book, acknowledging lucifer, is called, rules for radicals, and was written by saul alinsky. the antidote to the affordable care act is an evolution. in deference to the bill of rights, federal oversight and taxing for health care must completely give way to state and local oversight. i call this evolution, medistate. by way of medistate, the states, local governments and private organizations would then have the money to doctor and nurse if they were not being robbed by the absurdly expensive bureaucracy of the federal system.",288
