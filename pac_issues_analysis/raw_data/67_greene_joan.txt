We can only win this with your help. You fuel our grassroots movement. Would you consider a small donation? Every dollar makes a difference.

Joan has a plan to help veterans and their families in the East Valley.

It's time to stop the division, stop the political bickering and move our country forward. I will always stand for safety, security and our American values. Country over party is the only path.

“I support Joan Greene because she offers realistic ideas on how to improve American life.”

Joseph, AZ-05 resident and supporter

Joan believes that everyone deserves access to affordable, quality healthcare.

Joan will protect retirement security and fight for fair wages

Joan is a small business owner with a proven track record of balancing budgets, listening to the needs of people, and making sure there is a win-win. It is not only irresponsible to not invest in technology, healthcare, research and provide a quality education, it is not good business. It is not good for our people, not good for our Country and we will continue to lose our standing on the world stage. It will cost our state and country more to not implement these plans.Joan is running to represent AZ-05 in U.S. Congress. She is fighting to protect our families and give us a voice. Our communities deserve economic security, affordable healthcare, and quality education for our kids.
