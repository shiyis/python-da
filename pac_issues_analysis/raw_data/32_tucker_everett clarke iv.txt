“I believe in empowering our state’s families, workers, seniors, and children by working across the aisle to get things done. As a former state representative, I did exactly that to increase access to health care for families, education for children, and economic opportunity for workers across Arkansas.”

In an age of hyper-partisanship and endless gridlock, I fundamentally and sincerely believe there is more that brings us together than pulls us apart. At the end of the day, we all want the same thing: to be safe and healthy, to provide for ourselves and our family, and to leave the world a better place for our children and their children.

— Clarke Tucker

Since 1948, War Memorial Stadium has brought Arkansans from every corner of the state together for sporting events, concerts, and more.

The Arkansas Arts Center is a cultural hub for learning, inspiration, and artistic expression.

A centerpiece of Little Rock’s downtown, the River Market features delicious food, family-friendly recreation, and a growing small business scene.

Little Rock’s Riverfront Park offers an abundance of outdoor activities, sights, and infrastructure marvels like the Big Dam Bridge.

Join us as we fight for a better Arkansas.

My name is Clarke Tucker, and I am a lifelong Arkansan who grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas.

My family, faith, and community are what guide me, inspire me, and ultimately make me who I am. To me, running for office is about serving those who have shaped me and ensuring that every Arkansan has the opportunity to succeed in their version of the American dream.

I have a law practice in Little Rock, where my incredible wife Toni and I live and raise our two active and always entertaining kids, Ellis and Mari Francis.

My name is Clarke Tucker, and I am a lifelong Arkansan who grew up right here in Little Rock and went to Central High School. After attending law school at the University of Arkansas, I returned to Little Rock because there is no place on earth I would rather live, work, and raise my family. In 2014, I ran for the state legislature, serving two terms representing my friends, family, and neighbors in House District 35. During those four years, I focused on empowering our state’s families, workers, seniors, and children by working across the aisle to get things done. Now I am excited to do the same for Senate District 32.

In 2017, I was diagnosed with bladder cancer. I am so grateful to be able to say I am cancer-free today, but that experience gave me a newfound perspective on life and deepened my understanding of what public service is all about.
