Congressman Jim Himes is a tireless voice for common-sense, independent solutions to the challenges facing Connecticut. He’s looking out for the middle class, fighting for affordable health care for all, taking on special interests like the NRA to end gun violence, and working to create economic opportunity for working families.

Jim Himes has been a consistent leader working with both sides of the aisle to bring a commonsense approach to solve the problems Americans and Connecticut residents face every day.

Himes for Congress will be an official 2021 Democracy Summer partner! Developed by Maryland Congressman (and law professor) Jamie Raskin, Democracy Summer is an educational program dedicated to training the next generation of political activists, organizers, and leaders. In 2021, for the first time ever, Democracy Summer is expanding nationally in partnership with the DCCC and Democratic campaigns across America.
