“When wealth is lost, nothing is lost; when health is lost, something is lost; when character is lost, all is lost.” Big Character > Big Pockets #MotivationMonday #Character #Inspire

There is no way for anyone to effectively help others if we do not help ourselves first. This isn’t selfish in nature! On an airplane they tell us to put the mask on ourselves first before helping someone else. Take care of yourself first so you can help someone else!

Thank you for taking time to stop by! My mission as a public servant is to connect with community members with the intent to encourage, support, and do the work of public service. If enhancing your community is something you seek to do or have a passion for, let’s connect! Remember, whether searching for or living out your purpose, public service is not only something we all can do but it is a duty we owe to our respective communities.

You cannot pour from an empty cup. There is no way for you, I, or anyone else to effectively help others if we do not help ourselves first. This isn’t selfish in nature! On an airplane they tell us to put the mask on ourselves first before helping someone else. Take care of yourself first so you can help someone else! #MotivationMonday #Inspire #Perspective #Efficiency

Major key alert 🔑🔑 Gaining control of your emotions and thoughts will open a gateway that you once thought was impossible to get through. They’re your emotions, they’re your thoughts, take ownership of them and make your dreams turn into realities! #MotivationalMonday #EmotionIntelligence #MentalStrength #DreamsToReality
