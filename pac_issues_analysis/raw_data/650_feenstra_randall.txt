Shaped by a small, religious community in Sioux County, Randy …

Taxpayer Champion Randy is a strong fiscal conservative who fights for Iowa taxpayers. In the State Senate, he worked alongside Governor Reynolds and was the key architect of the largest state income tax cut in state history. Randy also led the way on reducing property taxes for Iowa’s working families and seniors. In Congress, he’ll fight against the liberal attempts to eliminate the Trump tax cuts.

Stopping Illegal Immigration Randy agrees with President Trump that we must secure our southern border. In the State Senate, Randy supported the law that banned sanctuary cities in Iowa and in Congress, Randy will support building the wall while opposing Nancy Pelosi’s and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s reckless open borders policies that are endangering Iowa communities.

Defending Our 2nd Amendment Randy is a Constitutional Conservative with a record of delivering results to defend our God-given liberties, like our 2nd Amendment. In the Iowa Senate, Randy supported the largest expansion of 2nd Amendment rights in Iowa history. He supported Iowa’s stand your ground law, co-sponsored the constitutional carry bill and has helped stop the implementation of red flag laws in Iowa. He is 100% opposed to any infringement on our 2nd Amendment rights and that’s why he received an A Rating from the NRA.
