Born in Cuba in 1954, Gimenez immigrated to the United States with his family following the Cuban Revolution in 1960. His family settled in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood and Gimenez has been a Miami-Dade resident ever since. Mayor Gimenez has dedicated his life to his community and the people of Miami-Dade County as a firefighter, an administrator and as an elected public servant.

Carlos has spent the last nine years fighting to lower taxes, balance the budget, protect the environment and more. Now, he’s building on this record as a candidate for Congress. In order to better serve South Florida, Carlos wants to hear directly from you. Tell him what matters to you and how you want to see him advocate for you on Day One in Congress!
