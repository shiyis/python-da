Georgia Can’t Wait.

 <tag> p




Our healthcare system is broken, our economy works only for the good old boys, voter suppression is at an all time high, and our confidence in government is at an all time low.

Andrew Ferguson for GA

I’m Andrew Ferguson, and I’m running for Congress, but I’m not doing it alone. If we want a government that works for everyday Georgians, we need a movement powered by everyday Georgians. I hope you’ll join us.

And we haven’t even gotten to climate change.

Georgia can’t wait.

We can’t wait on any of the above, but we also can’t wait on any one person or politician to figure everything out for us. No one person has all the answers.
