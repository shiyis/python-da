Paul Walker for Congress

 <tag> p


Just a quick note to say that I won't be running for Congress in 2020. I plan on considering a run in 2022 or 2024. I am grateful for all of your support and will miss interactions with all of you. However, it comes down to this: I have a lot of projects at work to complete this year and it simply feels impossible to overcome the significant deficit of votes in our district, especially this year. I remain committed to the same ideals: respect, social justice, workforce development, education, and healthcare reform. I will be glad to help anyone this year in ways that I can, and will also be working to build up the foundation our new governor has set that supports our ideals, so we can all make a real difference for the people of Kentucky.

Working Kentuckians have been abandoned by our leaders. Education, healthcare, farmers, unions – all abandoned. Every person deserves fair wages, financial security, and affordable access to education and healthcare. As your representative, I will listen to you with respect and make decisions that benefit everyone’s quality of life – and I won’t abandon you. I’m a Murray State professor qualified to be a dedicated voice for you and all of District 1 in Washington.
