Susan is currently a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, where she chairs the Senate Transportation Appropriation Subcommittee. In that role, Susan has secured more than $721 million to help improve Maine’s roads, bridges, airports, seaports and other critical infrastructure. She also serves as Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, and as a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) and the Senate Intelligence Committees.

Susan Collins was born into a family with a strong tradition of public service and commitment to Maine. Her parents, Don and Patricia, both served as mayor of her hometown of Caribou. Don served five terms in the State Legislature, and Pat served on a wide variety of boards and commissions - from the University of Maine System Board of Trustees to the Catholic Charities of Maine. Susan had great role models in her home who taught her at an early age that you had no right to complain if you weren't willing to get involved and work to solve the problems.

Susan lives in Bangor with her husband Tom and their black lab, Pepper.

Susan has a long record of significant legislative accomplishments in such critical areas as health care, improving the economy and growing jobs in Maine, helping Maine’s small businesses thrive, education, national security, veterans, and helping older Americans.

When Mainers need help, they turn to Susan Collins. Constituent service has always been one of her top priorities in Washington and in her six constituent service centers around Maine. During her time in the Senate, she has helped tens of thousands of her constituents with problems with federal agencies. That’s why Susan is valued as someone who works hard and gets the job done.

Susan is honored by the trust placed in her and privileged to serve Maine. First elected in 1996, Susan won reelection in 2002 by 16%, and in a highly competitive race in 2008, Susan won reelection by 23%. She not only won in each of Maine's 16 counties, but she outpolled President Barack Obama by 4%. Most recently, Susan was overwhelmingly reelected in 2014 with more than 68% of the vote.

A native of Aroostook County, Susan learned common-sense values and the importance of hard work as a young girl. One of her first jobs was picking potatoes for a local farmer. She babysat, and she worked at the Caribou Public Library reading to children during "Story Hour." As your United States Senator, Susan is an effective and tireless advocate for Maine families. She is a proven leader who is respected by colleagues on both sides of the aisle, is consistently ranked the most bipartisan senator, and she has been recognized by her colleagues as one of the hardest working members of Congress. During her entire time in the U.S. Senate, she has never missed a roll-call vote – more than 7,300!
