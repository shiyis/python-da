Dear Friend,

Frederica S. Wilson Proudly Representing Florida’s 24th Congressional District

During my time in Congress, I have been fighting for good, fair-paying jobs in safe environments for our workers; increased and better opportunities for our children; and safety, security, and prosperity in our communities. I am working hard both in Florida and in Washington, D.C., to advocate for us and to ensure that our voices are heard.

“Congresswoman Wilson has distinguished herself as a fierce advocate for hardworking families to ensure that they have equal access to ladders of opportunity.… She is an influential and impassioned voice in the fight for sensible gun control measures. Leaders like Congresswoman Wilson are needed in Congress to continue to put Floridians back to work, to protect critical investments and programs like education, Social Security and Medicare, and to help keep them safe."
