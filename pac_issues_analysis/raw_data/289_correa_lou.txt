 <tag> p




Santa Ana, CA— Following an outpouring of support from various elected leaders and organizations including Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, the Hispanic Business Roundtable Institute (HBRI), and Assemblymember Cheryl Brown, today, the California Association of Highway Patrolmen (CAHP) announced their official endorsement of former State Senator Lou Correa in his bid to represent California’s 46th Congressional District in Washington.

Santa Ana, CA— Following weeks of sweeping endorsements from a variety of elected officials and influential organizations, including the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 12 and Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, today, the California Young Democrats (CYD) Latino Caucus announced their official support of former State Senator Lou Correa in the race to represent California’s 46th Congressional District. The CYD Latino Caucus was established in 2006 by the California Young Democrats in an effort to engage a growing Latino population.

Santa Ana, CA— Adding to the ever-growing list of labor organizations supporting Lou Correa including the California Labor Federation, the California School Employees Association (CSEA), and the California State Association of Letter Carriers (CSALC), this week, the Operating Engineers Local 12 announced their endorsement of former State Senator Lou Correa for CA-46. The Operating Engineers Local 12 represents over 20,000 equipment operators, mechanics, concrete pumpers, soil testers, inspectors, and surveyors.

To ensure your ballot is properly delivered, the Orange County Registrar of Voters recommends hand delivering your ballot return envelope to your local post office. For voters wishing for peace of mind without visiting the post office, two 47 cent stamps may be placed on your ballot return envelope, however this may result in overpaying for postage.

Here at the Lou Correa for Congress campaign we want to make sure every vote is counted. That is why we’re reminding you that this year, some permanent absentee voters may need to put additional postage on their ballot return envelope.

Santa Ana, CA— On the heels of receiving key endorsements from Assemblywoman Cheryl Brown and Orange County Civil Rights Leader Sylvia Mendez, today, former State Senator Lou Correa secured backing from Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard in his campaign to represent CD-46 in Congress.
