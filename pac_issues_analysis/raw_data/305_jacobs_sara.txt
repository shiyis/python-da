"I’ve dedicated my career to building a better, safer world. That means working with people from all backgrounds to find common ground and make progress for those who need it most."

 <tag> p


A third-generation San Diegan, Sara Jacobs has dedicated her career to fighting for the most vulnerable people by making institutions and policy fairer and more equitable, and finding innovative solutions to some of the most complex problems. Currently in her first term in Congress, Sara is the youngest Member of Congress from California and the third youngest Member in all of Congress.

Sara has also served in policy positions at the U.S. State Department during the Obama Administration, UNICEF, and the United Nations, and as a Scholar in Residence at the Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies at the University of San Diego. She was also proud to use her expertise to serve as a policy advisor to Secretary Hillary Clinton during her 2016 campaign for president.

Sara served as the founding CEO of Project Connect, an education non-profit dedicated to closing the opportunity gap for students around the world by mapping and connecting schools to the Internet. The project was so successful that it is now a flagship part of UNICEF’s work around the world.

(619) 259-0215

Beyond Congress, Sara is the Founding Chair of San Diego for Every Child: The Coalition to End Child Poverty. Since its inception in fall of 2018, San Diego for Every Child has grown into a broad coalition of groups working toward the goal of halving the experience of childhood poverty in San Diego County by 2030. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, San Diego for Every Child started the COVID-19 Children’s Fund, helping to mobilize millions of dollars in philanthropic and government funding to support child care for essential workers and equitable distance learning for students throughout San Diego County.

PO Box 120085 San Diego, CA 92112

Sara grew up in our San Diego community and is a proud alumna of the San Diego public school system. She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and a Master of International Affairs degree in International Security Policy and Conflict Resolution, both from Columbia University.
