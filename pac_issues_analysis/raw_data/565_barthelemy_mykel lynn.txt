P.O. BOX 421003 Sandy Springs, GA 30342

Patriots are a threat to the establishment. We make America strong and resilient. They know that if we stick together and unify, nothing can break us down. We have come too far, to tolerate the threat of impeachment and socialism. What’s sad is that the current occupant in the House of Representatives sitting in the seat of Georgia’s 6th District voted to impeach the President. This cowardly act contributed to the division of our country.

I’m Mykel Barthelemy, and I’m running for Congress in Georgia’s 6th District

I’m not a politician, not even close. I’m an ordinary person who has a story similar to many Americans.

Elderly persons in Georgia’s 6th District needing assistance, please click on the “book” button below to schedule arrangements. If you want to volunteer to help homebound seniors in GA-6, please fill out the volunteer form on this website. Note that a $1.00 charge will apply to verify identity, but will be refunded when the errand is complete.

I am a Christian Conservative, Patriot, wife, mother, grandmother, businesswoman and the author of the newly released book, “Trump Is Not A Racist! Here’s Why.” I am married to the love of my life, Charles Barthelemy, a successful businessman and banker. Together, we run a thriving commercial banking business, Barthelemy Commercial Capital in Atlanta, GA.

Georgia’s 6th congressional district consists of many of the northern suburbs of Atlanta and includes portions of eastern Cobb County, northern Fulton County, and northern Dekalb County. The district includes all or portions of the cities of Roswell, Johns Creek, Tucker, Alpharetta, Marietta, Milton, Mountain Park, Sandy Springs, Brookhaven, Chamblee, Doraville, and Dunwoody.

I will fight against socialism! I will fight for your right to bear arms and protect your families. I will fight for your freedom of religion and the free exercise thereof. I will fight to keep our borders safe. I will fight to keep our taxes low. I will fight to make sure that you, a citizen of this great nation, are placed first over the rest of the world.

Hi, I’m Mykel Barthelemy. I’m a wife, mother, grandmother, author, and businesswoman. I’m a regular person, a concerned citizen, and a political outsider. I am also a Christian Patriot who loves the country that our ancestors and forefathers built. I’m the Left’s worst nightmare because my nonconformity destroys their narrative. I am living proof that most Americans love their country and do not want to see it torn apart.

For decades, we have trusted these elected individuals with our freedoms, livelihoods, and the way of life that made this country great. We foolishly placed our lives in the hands of these swamp creatures. Now I realize that for many years, we lived with a false sense of security, living in a state of hypnosis when danger was right under our noses.

The proof of their corruption is in their reaction to the greatest President in the history of our country that ever lived. While America is living her best life and thriving, the Democrats are furious! President Donald Trump promised to drain the swamp, and the swamp struck back!

We now have a booming economy, a record-breaking stock market, and the lowest unemployment numbers in history — because of the policies that President Donald Trump put forth. ISIS is decimated, and the highest-ranking terrorist leaders have been killed…all because of our great President. Nonetheless, the Democrats want to impeach him for nothing more than saving America out of their hands.

Even though my education and background is in art, I found myself in business management. At 15 years old, I managed my family’s small convenience store and by the age of 19 I opened my first business called “Designs by Mykel.” I designed wedding dresses and accessories and even attempted to get an SBA Business loan!

In 1994, I felt the calling of God on my life and I became ordained as a licensed minister and evangelist, (and later as a Pastor) and went on to pastor various churches. Known as a spiritual advisor to many church leaders, I have a reputation for my accurate insight, intelligence, godly wisdom, love, guidance, and mentorship. My ministerial advisory services are free of charge.

In 1998, as part of the inner circle of No Limit Records with cousin Percy Miller, Sr. (Master P), I started an outreach ministry and opened several highly successful businesses. I opened a hair replacement business, designed and sold hair products. I also opened a classified newspaper called “Money Saver Weekly Shopper” as well as a window cleaning company called “We Do Windows.” The window cleaning business was created primarily to provide employment opportunities for low-income church members. All profits from that business were used to pay the employees, I kept none for myself.

I am one of those fighters, armed with commonsense and a conservative moral compass. I will go to Washington and stand up for what is right!

In 2011, given my skill in leadership, communication and administration, I was requested to become the communications director for the Reform Party 2012 Presidential Nominee Andre Barnett. I also provided imaging, branding and graphic design services for the campaign. I developed relationships and worked closely with media outlets such as The Huffington Post, the Daily Caller, and the like. I wrote press releases, bios, and communications on behalf of the candidate and the campaign. In the end, I also sometimes acted in the role of campaign manager.

Many of our seniors cannot leave their homes because of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. In wake of the COVID-19 national and local emergency declarations, the Barthelemy for Congress Campaign is offering limited errand service for homebound elderly persons free of charge (picking up prescriptions, grocery shopping, etc.)

I was Creole born and raised on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana under Cajun French, African American and Native American Indian ancestry and raised by both parents. In 1985, I pursued my Bachelor’s degree at the University of Southwestern Louisiana, now called the University of Louisiana, majoring in Commercial Arts and minored in Philosophy. Because I became a mother at the age of 18 and a wife at 19, I later had to drop out due to financial hardships.

When I observed the hypocrisy, dishonesty, greed and the lack of basic common sense amongst many politicians in Washington, I came to a nightmarish epiphany. The corruption is far worse than we could have possibly imagined.

In 2004, I was hired as a sub-contractor for the United States Small Business Administration Office of Disaster Assistance in (SBA/ODA) in Atlanta, GA and re-located my family. There I worked in the disaster loan department in servicing and updating loan files. I was shortly promoted in a different department within the agency in accounting and procurement and later managed that department. Reporting directly to the agency’s Head Administrators, I played a very significant role in the Federal Government’s SBA Office of Disaster Assistance (ODA) during the most cataclysmic natural disaster in American history, Hurricane Katrina; I was like a “Joseph” during that time. I was given subordinate Federal purchasing authority with an acquisition and spending budget approved by Congress to fund the operation of various ODA headquarters. Those funds were used and to procure resources, services, and supplies that were distributed amongst Federal employees to assist needy disaster victims. I was an advocate of disaster assistance information to prolific churches and economic development non-profit corporations all over the country that assisted needy residents displaced by Hurricane Katrina. I initiated the Federal liquidation of $1.5 million dollars in office assets to local churches, schools, and ministries in Metro Atlanta Area.

We have made many gains under President Trump that we cannot afford to lose. We need strong fighters in Washington with backbone, who cannot be bought, and who really love this country.

With the help of Almighty God, I cannot and will not fail. We cannot afford to lose Georgia District 6 again. I believe I am the best person for this fight and with your help, together, we can Make Georgia District 6 Great Again!

I gained my work experience in management in garment manufacturing and retail management from 1987 to 2000. I supervised at Garan, Inc., and Fruit of the Loo, Inc. and worked in garment retail senior management and training at Edison Brothers, Inc. and Fredericks of Hollywood. At Edison Brothers, Inc., I pulled low-volume high shrinkage retail stores out of the red into the black, increasing annual volumes up to 25%. It was then that I discovered my talent for business development (and so did the companies I worked for.) From that point on, I was in demand at Edison Brothers and was promoted to manage multimillion-dollar volume stores and I became a trainer.

I am a survivor of domestic violence from my previous marriage and have suffered tremendously in many areas of my life from poverty to homelessness. When I was a single/divorced mother of 3 small daughters, I always had to work multiple jobs, sometimes two and three jobs at the same time. I had to multi-task and wear many hats as a Jill-of–All-Trades, to keep bread on the table.

I had no idea until last year that I would even consider becoming an elected official. However, after witnessing the last 4 years of the unveiling of the blatant corruption in Washington, I realized that we could really lose our country— because we almost did 4 years ago. That made me wake up to the dangers of our current political environment. For this reason, I knew I had to do something. I felt a calling that I believe is from God, just the same way I felt when I became a minister over 27 years ago. I love my God and my country and I must do my part to preserve what God has given us as a free nation.

At Edison Brothers, Inc., I pulled low-volume high shrinkage retail stores out of the red into the black, increasing annual volumes up to 25%. It was then that I discovered my talent for business development (and so did the companies I worked for.) From that point on, I was in demand at Edison Brothers and was promoted to manage multimillion-dollar volume stores and I became a trainer.

I am a survivor of domestic violence from my previous marriage and have suffered tremendously in many areas of my life from poverty to homelessness. When I was a single/divorced mother of 3 small daughters, I always had to work multiple jobs, sometimes two and three jobs at the same time. I had to multi-task and wear many hats as a Jill-of–All-Trades, to keep bread on the table.

I had no idea until last year that I would even consider becoming an elected official. However, after witnessing the last 4 years of the unveiling of the blatant corruption in Washington, I realized that we could really lose our country— because we almost did 4 years ago. That made me wake up to the dangers of our current political environment. For this reason, I knew I had to do something. I felt a calling that I believe is from God, just the same way I felt when I became a minister over 27 years ago. I love my God and my country and I must do my part to preserve what God has given us as a free nation.
