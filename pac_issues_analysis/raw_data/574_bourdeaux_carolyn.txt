Meet Carolyn Bourdeaux

Carolyn has been called to public service her entire life. She has spent her career working on public policy solutions to improve people’s lives. She is committed to health care reform, investing in education and making our government work for us again, not the special interests. Carolyn lives in Suwanee with her eight-year-old son Nathan and husband Jeff.

Winning this seat took all of us coming together to build a diverse and inclusive coalition. I’m thrilled that so many amazing elected officials and community leaders are on our side. Together, we finished what we started.

Supporters

This campaign is powered by you and our grassroots movement-- not the special interest groups that seek to control Washington. It’s why I reject corporate PAC money, and why my focus is always our district and our needs. But I need you with me. Sign up today to join our team.

Growing up, my parents always taught me the importance of service on behalf of others. As a policy expert and the mother of a seven-year-old, I care deeply about my son’s future and the future of all our children. Our community deserves a representative who has the courage to stand up for our children’s future, to reform our democracy, to ensure access to affordable health care and a system of world-class education. In 2018, we came within 433 votes of flipping this seat. I ran because I believe in a country that is diverse, inclusive and global in its outlook and aspirations. Thank you for joining me in this fight and helping us finish the job.
