Ryan Lucas is the Chief Information Officer and Security Officer for a leading behavioral healthcare company headquartered in Colorado, which means that Ryan's work depends on using accurate data and facts to make decisions, a mindset sorely lacking in Congress today. Ryan helps businesses and healthcare providers nationwide leverage technology to ensure that patients and their doctors have secure access to their health records and that they receive the high-quality, affordable care they deserve. Ryan has significant experience overseeing budgets and managing teams working to modernize how medical professionals access private health information, allowing them to make better decisions about their patients’ care. Ryan’s work has given him unique insights into how, through innovation, the private and public sector can work together to improve people’s lives.

Ryan will put his experience and expertise to work for you by launching a first-of-its-kind secure online forum where the people of CD-5 will be able to voice their concerns in real time and debate ideas for legislation that could help our families, businesses, and communities to grow and prosper. Ryan also believes transparency is the key to restoring trust in our public institutions. And Ryan knows that good ideas come from listening to all stakeholders, from small business entrepreneurs, to civic and faith-based organizations, to students and senior citizens, to parents struggling to make ends meet. That’s why we must put an end to the back-room dealing that plagues our political system.

Check out this introduction to Ryan and why he is the right person to represent CD 5.

Copyright © 2020 Ryan Lucas for Colorado All Rights Reserved.

From day one in office, Ryan will restore accountability by allowing every CD-5 constituent to read, debate, and take a poll on every bill before Ryan votes on it. Striking the right balance to meet all of our diverse interests won’t always be easy, but you will always know who proposed and how Ryan voted on the laws passed in your name. Together, we can restore faith in American democracy by truly holding our elected representatives accountable to we, the people. This isn’t about liberal or conservative, it’s about liberty and the Constitution. Join us!
