Congratulations to Jeanne Ives for her hard fought win. I will continue to support the Republican candidates in the upcoming November elections.

Many ask if I would have done this if I had known the outcome in advance. The answer is yes. Had I not, I would have never got to know and spend time with our great group of volunteers.

Thank you to those that joined me in the arena.

Results are in and the voters have spoken. Unfortunately we did not prevail.

I would like to thank all our volunteers and friends who loyally fought with us. I would also like to thank all the voters who supported us. Most of all I would like to thank my family who sacrificed their time and energy helping me.
