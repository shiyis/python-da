A LEADER FOR COLORADO

PO Box 32145 Aurora, CO 80041-2145

I’m proud to serve Colorado’s sixth district because I believe America’s most important values and priorities are under assault, and Colorado is ready for a new generation of leadership. Raised in a working-class family and having served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, I believe public servants should serve the public interest, not the special interests.

For Jason, advocacy isn’t just speeches and talk. It has to be about action and results. Jason serves Colorado’s veterans and now he serves the 6th District in Congress where he fights to end corruption and the influence of money in politics, to keep our communities safe from gun violence, and to protect Colorado’s working families.
