A third-generation San Diegan, Sara Jacobs has dedicated her career to fighting for the most vulnerable people by making institutions and policy fairer and more equitable, and finding innovative solutions to some of the most complex problems. Currently in her first term in Congress, Sara is the youngest Member of Congress from California and the third youngest Member in all of Congress.

Beyond Congress, Sara is the Founding Chair of San Diego for Every Child: The Coalition to End Child Poverty. Since its inception in fall of 2018, San Diego for Every Child has grown into a broad coalition of groups working toward the goal of halving the experience of childhood poverty in San Diego County by 2030. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, San Diego for Every Child started the COVID-19 Children’s Fund, helping to mobilize millions of dollars in philanthropic and government funding to support child care for essential workers and equitable distance learning for students throughout San Diego County.
