As an infant, Makki and her family escaped an oppressive religious regime in Iran after the Revolution in 1979, known for its persecution of dissidents, to come to America. With the little resources they could quickly scrape together, they escaped to come to the Land of Opportunity, where anyone with a dream and a good work ethic could become successful. While Makki’s father studied to become a surgeon, her mother was a childcare provider and delivered Yellow Pages to provide the family’s income. Makki witnessed her parents drive to succeed and commitment to the American Dream, which motivated her to start working at the young age of 15.

P.O. Box 47483

Makki grew up in Montgomery County, Maryland and is a graduate of the University of Maryland, where she obtained her degrees in Finance and Business Management and the Catholic University of America where she obtained her law degree. Makki is also proficient in Spanish.

As a Farsi language speaker, Makki was appointed by the George W. Bush Administration to serve the Army General Counsel at the Pentagon just weeks after the September 11 terrorist acts. Makki went on to serve as senior Republican Healthcare Advisor in both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, and before the age of 40, became one of the youngest partners at K&L Gates, one of the nation’s premier law firms. While Makki’s work at K&L Gates focused on health care policy, she also was engaged in the firm’s pro-bono efforts providing assistance through Legal Counsel for the Elderly, a leading provider of free legal services.
