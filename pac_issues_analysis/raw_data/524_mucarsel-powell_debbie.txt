Debbie has spent her career working to expand access to health care for families across South Florida.

Debbie Mucarsel-Powell immigrated to the United States as a young girl with her mother and sisters – in search of opportunities to better their lives. Debbie has early memories of the one-room apartment they lived in, while her mother worked double shifts as a home health care provider and attended school in the evenings and on the weekends to learn English.
