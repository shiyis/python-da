Some of his legislative priorities during his Assembly years were lowering taxes, creating an economic environment for small businesses to thrive, supporting our Armed Forces and our veterans, and protecting our Second Amendment rights. Jones' legislative achievements include the introduction and co-authorship of "Made in America" legislation, which makes it easier for manufacturers to do business in California, legislation to support the growing craft beverage industry in California, and legislation allowing non-motorized vehicles such as scooters, bicycles, and wheelchairs in skate parks. He became well known for his annual Second Amendment Awareness event, which educated his constituents on their Second Amendment rights and helped attendees learn how to control a firearm safely.
