Senator Rodríguez has been fighting for his constituents during the public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. In order to slow the spread of this disease and protect the most vulnerable among us, it’s important for all of us to stay updated and follow the guidance of local, state, and federal agencies. We have dedicated this site to providing important updates, resources and information on COVID-19.

José Javier Rodríguez is a member of the Florida Senate, and serves District 37 in Miami-Dade County. Senator Rodríguez has established a track record as a bold voice in the Florida Legislature for everyday working families, the environment and consumers. He and his wife Sonia are raising two young sons and live in the City of Miami.

The elderly and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems and diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness.

Our opponent has the full support of Governor DeSantis and the Republican leadership. JJR needs your help to win this race. Can you make a donation today?
