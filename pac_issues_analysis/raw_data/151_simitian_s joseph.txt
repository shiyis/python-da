The new facility is run by the homeless services agency HomeFirst, and is seen as a much-needed replacement for the old Sunnyvale Armory. The armory provided 125 beds to homeless people in the North County during the cold winter months before it was closed down in early 2014. There was already little in the way of shelter space in the northern end of the county, and homeless people looking for a warm place to stay had to be referred to the Boccardo Reception Center down in San Jose.

"The armory had seen a lot of years of wear and tear. In many ways, this is an upgrade," Simitian said.

Mr. Simitian, the county supervisor, says his father bought a Palo Alto home on his schoolteacher’s salary. His best friend, later a Palo Alto mayor, was the son of an air-conditioning mechanic who worked two jobs to buy a house.

Community leaders want to prevent that. Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe Simitian is heading a campaign to keep Buena Vista intact and has put together $39 million, mostly city and county money. His group made an informal bid to Mr. Jisser last week, and he says he hopes to find private donations to augment the funds and make the bid competitive.

Soon, they may be forced out. With property values soaring, the park’s longtime owners, 44-year-old Joe Jisser and his parents, are fielding inquiries from developers eager for a rare large slice of Palo Alto. The value of the park’s 4.5 acres could be as much as $55 million, local real-estate agents say.

Privacy advocates say the Santa Clara regulation would be one of the broadest anti-surveillance measures being considered anywhere in the US. As Washington remains deadlocked over how to put a leash on an ever-growing list of surveillance technology used by state and local police departments, it will probably be up to city councils and county boards to play watchdog.

Read Joe's op-ed here

His efforts come as Congress and states have moved to regulate specific electronic surveillance methods, such as aerial drones, bulk telephone record collection, and devices that impersonate a cell tower to intercept calls.

Read the article in the Wall Street Journal here

One of the broadest pushes to reel in America’s surveillance state isn’t in Congress, the White House or a courtroom; arguably it’s in Joe Simitian’s office in California’s Santa Clara County government building.

Read the article in the Guardian here

County Supervisor Joe Simitian spearheaded an effort, starting in April 2014, to find a replacement for the armory. Options were pretty limited, Simitian told the Voice in June. The hot real estate market meant trying to find a new location for a shelter in the North County had been nothing short of a "Herculean task."

So Simitian’s draft ordinance would require the local sheriff or any county agency to get board approval if it wants to buy any new piece of surveillance technology or use an existing system in a new way. This applies to any “technological tool used, designed or primarily intended to collect … information specifically associated with, or capable of being associated with, any individual or group”.

Read the article in the Mountain View Voice here

Frankly, my first thought was, "That can't be right." But as too many families in our county already knew, and as I would quickly learn, it was entirely right. And it's entirely wrong.

News clips from Joe's work representing Silicon Valley...

The question Buena Vista poses, is “are we still that place?” he says, “Or have we priced ourselves out of the opportunities we could offer to almost anyone?”

Simitian said the portable building is ideal for the temporary location, and can be easily taken apart and put back together. While the facility itself appears modest, with no partitions, Simitian said the very open floor plan makes it easier to handle changes ratio of men, women and families who show up. Overall, he said, it's an improvement over the Sunnyvale Armory, even though it will only last through March.

But making laws takes a lot of time, and as new bits of spy kit continuously show up it can be hard to keep pace.

A block from multimillion-dollar homes and a few miles from the headquarters of GoogleInc. and Facebook Inc. sits Buena Vista Mobile Home Park, with 117 units that are home to about 400 residents, many of them Hispanic laborers.

His plan: Turn Buena Vista over to a nonprofit that operates trailer parks in California.

The facility itself is a portable building, pieced together in about a week, consisting of a single giant room full of bed rolls for people to sleep on. In the back is a kitchen area with tables for breakfast and lunch, where HomeFirst staff began serving up mashed potatoes to the people trickling in.

I remember the conversation well. I was talking to a constituent, a neighbor, at a community gathering. Out of the blue, she asked me a direct and unexpected question: Why don't we have any hospital beds here in Santa Clara County for teens who are at risk of hurting themselves or others?

Here in the center of Silicon Valley’s tech boom, one of America’s wealthiest enclaves is wrestling with an uncomfortable dilemma: whether it can afford to lose the city’s only trailer park.

One of their classmates was a daughter of a Hewlett-Packard Co. co-founder, says Mr. Simitian, 62. “None of us thought it odd that a mechanic’s, a teacher’s and a custodian’s kid would sit in the same classes with the CEO’s kid.”

Dozens of homeless people lined up outside of the North County's new cold weather shelter Monday night, seeking a meal and a warm place to sleep.

 <tag> p




Joe received his Bachelor of Arts degree, with academic honors, from The Colorado College. He also holds a Master of Arts degree in International Policy Studies from Stanford University, a Master of City Planning degree from the University of California at Berkeley, and a Juris Doctor law degree from the University of California at Berkeley (Boalt Hall). Raised in Palo Alto and a graduate of Palo Alto (“Paly”) High, Joe’s roots are in the South Bay and Midpeninsula. His community involvement includes service on the advisory boards of local organizations such as Actera, Hakone Gardens, and Adolescent Counseling Services.

Joe Simitian was elected to the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors in 2012. He represents the Fifth District, which includes Cupertino, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Saratoga, Stanford, and portions of Sunnyvale and San Jose.

During his current term on the Board of Supervisors, Joe has received recognition for his commitment to public service from the NAACP, the Los Altos Chamber of Commerce, the Los Altos Rotary Club, and Save our Shoes, among others.

Joe's public service over the years includes stints as a member of the California State Senate, the California State Assembly, Mayor of Palo Alto, President of the Palo Alto School Board, as well as an earlier term on the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors. He served as an election observer/supervisor in El Salvador and Bosnia, and participated in refugee relief and resettlement efforts in Albania and Kosovo. On the Board of Supervisors, Joe serves as Chair of the Finance and Government Operations Committee and Vice Chair of the Health and Hospitals Committee.

During his years in the State Legislature, Joe received Legislator of the Year awards from a wide range of organizations, including the California School Boards Association, AeA (the American Electronics Association), the California Library Association and NOW (the National Organization for Women). He regularly received “100%” environmental ratings from the California League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, and Vote the Coast. The California Journal identified Joe as among those at the “Top of the Class” during his first term in the Legislature. Later in his legislative career, the Capitol Weekly identified Joe as one of the half-dozen “Most Effective” members of the Legislature. San Jose Magazine repeatedly recognized him as one of the “Power 100 of Silicon Valley”, and in 2003 Joe was selected by Scientific American magazine as one of the “Scientific American 50” Leaders in Technology from around the world. Joe and his work have been quoted or noted in publications as diverse as The Atlantic, Conde Nast Traveller, Mother Jones, People Magazine, the Guardian, and Scientific American. His media appearances range from CNN to the “Dr. Phil Show”, from CTV (Canadian Television) to ABC Radio National in Australia. Joe brings to his work a unique perspective and background – service at all levels of local government; hands-on experience in the private sector as a public schools attorney, businessman, and certified city planner; a breadth of international interests and experience; as well as professional education and training particularly applicable to his work in government.
