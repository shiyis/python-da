Paid for by Cory Gardner for Senate

I'm proud of the work we were able to accomplish for all four corners of Colorado, and of my record as one of the Senate's most bipartisan members.

It has been the honor and privilege of my lifetime to serve Colorado in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. I believe in Colorado, I believe in the greatness of this country, and I believe we must be united together in our support for Senator Hickenlooper.

From the bottom of my heart, I cannot thank Coloradans enough for their enduring support and dedication to strengthening the Centennial State alongside me for the past ten years.

THANK YOU, COLORADO

From Jaime, Alyson, Thatcher, Caitlyn, and myself, thank you once again for your generosity, kindness, and support. We look forward to what's to come.
