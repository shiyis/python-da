Since 2008, Jackie has proudly represented San Francisco and San Mateo Counties in Washington. She has been a tireless champion for the continued health of Medicare and Social Security, a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions, scientific research, affordable college, and quality healthcare for all. She has introduced legislation to end sexual assault in the military, at colleges, and even in the halls of Congress, require background checks for all gun sales, and protect consumers from receiving frustrating robocalls. Jackie needs your help to bring California leadership, ideas, and innovation to Washington.
