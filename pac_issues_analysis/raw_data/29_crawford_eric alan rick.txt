However, we have a critical mission in Washington and that is dealing with our ongoing debt crisis. I have made it my top priority to address our debt crisis by enacting permanent spending controls so we can finally put the shovel down and start to get out the hole we have dug for ourselves. I fear that if we fail to adequately address our debt crisis the greatest threat to our nation, as described by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullin as our national debt, we will succumb to the immense weight of interest expenses on our debt that would soon overtake the total amount of money budgeted to run the Pentagon.

U.S. Representative for Arkansas' 1st Congressional District

Thank you for visiting my website!

It is an honor to serve the people of the First District as a member of the United States House of Representatives. Our district plays an important role in our nations economy in many different ways. Whether it’s our rice that is produced and shipped all over the world to our steel that is proudly made here in the U.S.A to our top of the line medical care provided at places like NEA Baptist and St. Bernard’s in Jonesboro. People all across the First District can be proud of the work they do that makes our communities a better place to live and call home.

Paid for & approved by Crawford for Congress

I hope you will consider joining Team Crawford as we continue to work hard, every day, to address our debt crisis in a meaningful way as well as fight to keep an over zealous federal government off our backs and out of our backyard’s.
