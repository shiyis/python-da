SIGN UP FOR THE LATEST FROM KELLY:

Two years ago, you gave me the honor of a lifetime by endorsing my campaign for Congress. And with your help, I was successful in becoming North Dakota’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Since that time, I have worked every day to be North Dakota’s voice in Washington, not Washington’s voice in North Dakota.

Like a lot of young North Dakota families, the Armstrongs are busy with their careers, school and youth sports, hunting, and more. Learn more about Kelly Armstrong, including Kelly’s career, his upbringing, local community service, conservative track record, and young family.

Sincerely, Kelly Armstrong

With strong leadership from President Trump, we have seen the true power of the American people, we have watched our economy thrive, our people take home more money in their paychecks, and our families have a greater outlook on life.

We can’t let up. I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to build on this progress. As I bring my campaign for re-election across the state of North Dakota, I need your help. Please join me in these efforts by signing up to be a member of Team Armstrong.
