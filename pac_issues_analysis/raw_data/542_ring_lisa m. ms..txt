I’m Lisa Ring, your candidate to represent the 1st Congressional District of Georgia in Washington, D.C. I am a mother of four, a military mom, and a former corrections officer.

We're tired of worrying if we'll be able to afford health care, or if, after honorably serving our country, we will be employable. We're frustrated that we work full-time and still can’t pay our bills, and that higher education is only within our reach if we take on crushing student loans.

Ready to take the next step?

Know where to vote!
