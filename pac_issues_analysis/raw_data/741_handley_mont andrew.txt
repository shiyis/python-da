I extend my sincere thank you to everyone who supported me during the primary election campaign. Unfortunately, the result did not go our way on June 2nd. Thank you for your encouragement, your enthusiasm and your vote. While this campaign comes to a close, the fight to end corruption and fraud in northwest Indiana is far from over.
