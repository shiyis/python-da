This is the type of person that we’ve all been saying to each other that we need in Washington D.C.

I have known John for several years and being like-minded in that government should be less not more. John wants to help folks where he can and then move out of the way and let progress do what it does best.

John strongly believes in the foundation of the constitution and is a staunch defender of States Rights.

I endorse John Nelson to represent Alaska in U.S. Congress. John knows that our overbloated government is often acting outside the confines of the Constitution and has the backbone to take a stand. We need a true Conservative representing us!

John Nelson is a strict Constitutionalist who believes in limited-government and is exactly who we need in Washington.

I fully endorse John Nelson’s Sound Succession Plan and encourage all Alaskans to get to know and understand the value of this man.

Restoring the core principles of the Constitution is my top priority. We must reduce federal overreach and restore sovereignty to the State of Alaska while preserving our culture and heritage for future generations.

Healthcare and healthcare insurance costs skyrocket while insurance carrier choices decline. Existing programs must be significantly changed to better protect our elderly and our Veterans.

My grandparents moved to Alaska in 1948 and settled in Anchorage. A product of the 1964 Good Friday Earthquake, I was born and raised in Alaska. In 1987 I married my wife Dawn, whose grandparents homesteaded in Willow in 1960. Dawn and I started our first business together shortly thereafter, and settled in Chugiak for the next 30 years. Dawn and I raised our 3 children in Chugiak, finally settling in Wasilla after becoming empty-nesters in 2018.

Restoring the core principles of the Constitution is my top priority. We must reduce federal overreach and restore sovereignty to the State of Alaska while preserving our culture and heritage for future generations.

Federal overreach and lower-48 regulations and restrictions must be eliminated to restore State sovereignty and allow for Alaska’s economic recovery and growth.

I fully endorse John Nelson’s Sound Succession Plan and encourage all Alaskans to get to know and understand the value of this man.

Federal Debt is out of control. We must stop mortgaging our grandchildren’s future at an unprecedented rate. We must pass a fiscally responsible budget and control federal spending.
