I have lived my entire adult life in our great state of Delaware. I began my teaching career at Immaculate Heart of Mary, and have coached at St. Elizabeth’s and St. Mark’s High Schools. I worked in the railroad industry for 35 years, starting as a conductor and ending in management. Since retiring I have pursued an acting career, appearing in commercials, film and TV.

Read about Lee and his campaign

Throughout life’s challenges, I have learned the importance of family, community and a government that protects and defends its citizens. Now a grandfather who is helping to raise two wonderful grandkids, I am committed to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves, and pledge to represent, with honor and fairness, my family and yours, and all Delawareans, in the U.S. Congress.
