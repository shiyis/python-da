His sincere commitment to continued service to our country has led him to seek to be your Congressman. As a devout family man and committed Christian, he now desires to apply his leadership skills to the challenges facing the families, individuals, and businesses of the 51st District.

Juan “Johnny” M. Hidalgo Jr. was born in San Diego and raised in National City. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and served with distinction in both war and peace for over 31 years. In his last assignment, he served as the Sergeant Major for the Joint Task Force of Guantanamo Bay (GTMO), Cuba. Along with his military experience, he obtained two college degrees and completed the National Defense University Executive Leadership Course.

He has adopted the motto, “Always Faithful,” to express his steadfast and proven commitment to all the constituents of California’s 51st Congressional District. He sincerely asks for your vote during the upcoming 2020 elections and promises to be your faithful representative.

His military career and education have more than adequately provided him the skills required to work for you. Tired of the unacceptable unemployment rate in the District? He will bring JOBS for everyone who is willing to work. Equally fed up with the fact that only 68% of our children are graduating high school? He will work to ensure your children and grandchildren have a quality EDUCATION. Tired of unsafe living conditions? He will work tirelessly to improve PUBLIC SAFETY.

We must elect a congressman that has never and will never put another country or it’s citizens before America. I have been all over the world and have worked with many foreign dignitaries. This is something that will be important as a congressman because I have not limited myself to working with my own but other cultures as well.

PUBLIC SAFETY

In 2016 and 2018 we ran for this same Congressional District. We came up short, but we met a lot of wonderful people throughout the District. We made a lot of good friends, have a lot more support and have the momentum to win in 2020. Since 2016 I have remained heavily engaged in the District. To me it is more than an election, it is about all the people who live and work in the District. I have been asked to run for other seats, positions, and districts, which might have been easier to win. However, I remain dedicated to the wonderful people of the 51st District. This is where I grew up and these are the people I need to work for.

Text 6197728106 to receive a free voters guide.

EDUCATION

JOBS

I want to give back to the great community that I came from, the community that made me what I am. Today more than ever we need real PROVEN leadership in Congress. I have been to and visited with citizens in all parts of the District. The citizens now know Juan Hidalgo, “The Right Juan.” And many more, than ever before, now support us.

Most of all I want to see our country return back to her state of greatness. We must stop all the childish bickering and name-calling. It is time the 51st District has a Congressman that will rise up and again work for ALL the citizens of the 51st District, California, and the United States of America. When you send me to DC you will be going with me. I will be your voice I will fight for you, your children and your grandchildren. I have served and fought for this great country of ours on foreign soil now I am here and ready to work for and fight for you in Washington DC.

I am not a politician and that is the last thing needed in Washington DC representing the 51st District. What I am, is a proven LEADER. This is exactly what we need now in Washington DC. I earnestly desire to diligently serve the hard working, family-oriented people of the 51st District! I believe the Americans of the 51st District have a pride that is like none other. I also believe TOGETHER we can make our country and the 51st District a better place.

After spending my entire adult life in service to our Country, many ask me now why I desire to be a Congressman. They make comments like, “You have served our country well, why not enjoy your retirement and relax?” The answer is really quite simple. Critical times are facing our country and the American people need proven leaders that are willing to do the work to see our region and our citizens prosper. I must serve, I have to serve . . . because it is what I have been trained to do. We need proven leaders that will put others before their own needs.
