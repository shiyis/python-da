Darren Soto was elected to Congress in 2016 to represent Florida’s 9th Congressional District, which includes all of Osceola county, and parts of Orange and Polk counties. Darren is proud to be the first person of Puerto Rican descent to serve in Congress from Florida.

PAID FOR AND AUTHORIZED BY DARREN SOTO FOR CONGRESS

During his nearly 4 years in the House, he has brought millions in federal funding back to the district for disaster relief, to improve infrastructure for SunRail, I-4 expansion and other new roads, to provide food and housing assistance, to support local agriculture, and to boost high tech high paying jobs, and help small businesses and the unemployed. In Congress, he’s also passed major legislation to increase hurricane readiness, protect Florida’s coasts from foreign offshore oil drilling, preserve marine life, honor veterans and civil rights heroes, map sinkholes, designate the Pulse National Memorial, provide Medicaid parity to Puerto Rico, and grant temporary protective status to Venezuelan refugees.

Darren Soto is an accomplished lawyer, legislator, environmentalist, and proud progressive representing the diverse, hardworking people of Central Florida in Congress. After graduating law school, Darren went into practice in Orlando to stand up for people in the courtroom (and play music on the side). He became involved with the Young Democrats and was elected to the Florida House at the age of 29. He served for 5 and a half years in the Florida House of Representatives before he was elected to Florida Senate, where he served for 4 years. During his nearly 10 years in the Florida Legislature, Darren worked to bring high-paying, high tech jobs to Central Florida; protect our clean air, land, and water; expand and protect health care; help families facing foreclosure; and improve education.

Darren is a graduate of Rutgers University and George Washington University School of Law. His wife, Amanda, has worked as a math and science coach in the Osceola and Orange County public schools and is a member of the Osceola County Classroom Teachers Association.

Florida's families deserve a leader who will champion bold, progressive solutions in the face of tough challenges.
