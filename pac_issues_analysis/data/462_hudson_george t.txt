“Serving as Fort Bragg’s Congressman is an honor and voters, as well as our troops, veterans and their families, deserve to know the truth about my record,” said Congressman Hudson. “Claims that I skipped out on pay raises for troops are lies and do not reflect my record of helping secure critical provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act to give troops a 10% raise, increase support for military family education, and expand access to the VA for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.”

Comments are closed.

While ads being run on TV and mailed to voters claim Congressman Hudson “skipped a vote to give military families a much needed pay raise” and “turned his back on military families,” these ads fail to mention that Congressman Hudson wrote sections of the National Defense Authorization Act which awarded a pay raise to troops, a 10% increase in Hazardous Duty Pay, strengthened and expanded the Preservation of the Force and Family program for Special Forces, expanded the VA’s Burn Pit Registry for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits in Egypt and Syria, strengthened the Exceptional Family Member Program that supports special needs education for military families, and improved Impact Aid funding for education around military bases.

Moore County, NC – Congressman Richard Hudson, Fort Bragg’s Congressman and candidate for North Carolina’s 8th Congressional District, was joined by veterans, military families and a Gold Star Spouse today for a virtual press conference to set the record straight on Congressman Hudson’s record of supporting troops, veterans and their families. Today’s announcement follows false and misleading advertisements from the House Majority Pac and DCCC on behalf of and by Congressman Hudson’s opponent, Patricia Timmons-Goodson claiming that Congressman Hudson “skipped out” on pay raises for troops. One ad run by Nancy Pelosi’s House Majority Pac, was deemed ‘mostly false’ by CBS 17.

Joining Congressman Hudson today were Concord City Councilman and veteran John Sweat, retired Army Sgt. Mike Verardo who was severely wounded in action as a member of the 82nd Airborne, Michelle Black, a Gold Star Spouse of 3rd Special Forces Group Sgt. Bryan Black who was killed in action in Tongo Tongo on Oct. 4, 2017, and Army Special Forces veteran John Zumwalt. Each speaker discussed Congressman Hudson’s record serving troops, their families and veterans.

But the reality is that most states already allow for reciprocity agreements with other states. Federal law also already prohibits violent criminals, abusers and stalkers from having guns; the issue is that some states already have tougher laws than at the federal level that could be overridden by permits from more lenient states. Still, the differences among most states may loom larger in the gun debate than in reality.

Hudson is facing Democratic challenger Patricia Timmons-Goodson in the race in North Carolina’s 8th Congressional District.

In a statement posted May 31 on his Congressional website, Hudson said he would not vote by proxy.

Hudson has taken to the airwaves repeatedly in the last several weeks to stump for his proposal and push back against what he sees as misinformation about his legislation.

As far as a primary focus currently, Hudson says veterans and the military are high on his list. Fort Bragg sits in the heart of his district. That fact, combined with the large number of veterans who have made North Carolina their home, has made Hudson want to focus on them and the issues concerning them, he says.

“My philosophy is if I’m you’re a congressman, I need to know you and you need to know me,” Hudson said. “So, I got here as soon as I could.”

“At the end of the day you’ve got to compromise,” he said. “As Senator Jesse Helms, one of my heroes, used to say ‘I won’t compromise my principles, but I will compromise my preferences’ and at the end of the day you’ve got to be willing to compromise some of your preferences and come back and fight for more later.”

Hudson said the largest obstacle to get a new spending bill passed comes in the ongoing argument between Democrats and Republicans over funding President Donald Trump’s border wall. He said the stalemate has led to a lack of negotiation between the two sides.

“When I heard about George “Buck” Perry’s life of service and his 100th birthday last month, I was honored to enter remarks into the Congressional Record honoring his commitment to our nation during WWII,” Hudson said. “When I heard he had two wishes on his 100th birthday — to renew his drivers license one more time and to meet President Trump, I thought the timing couldn’t be more perfect since we had a rally scheduled for March 2nd. I’m proud to report mission accomplished.”

“The biggest sticking point is the Democrats in Washington refuse to give the President any money for the border wall,” Hudson said. “And if there’s no wiggle room there, there’s no negotiations. I don’t know how you get out of that.”

Filed just over a month ago, legislation to treat concealed carry permits like drivers’ licenses nationwide is gaining steam in Congress but picking up opponents.

The bill easily passed the House by a 295-125 vote on July 21.

After filing for reelection on Dec. 2, Hudson released a statement.

Voters will have a bit of a foggy path to travel until the changes take effect. While voters in the re-drawn 8th district will choose their representative in the 2020 primary and general elections, the candidates chosen and eventually elected, won’t actually represent the new district until it becomes official in January of 2021.

Hudson introduced the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 on Congress’ first day in session for 2017. The bill, also known as H.R. 38, would eliminate the disorder of state carry laws by allowing individuals who have a license to carry permit from their resident state to exercise those rights across state lines.

“It’s flat out false to say that this bill will arm criminals or increase gun violence,” wrote Hudson in an op-ed published in U.S. News on Feb. 1. “If a criminal with malice wants to get a gun, I can guarantee he or she isn’t worried about following the laws on the books. Unfortunately, we can’t change that. But we can ensure law-abiding citizens can legally carry concealed firearms to defend themselves.”

“We’re also honored tonight to be joined by a true American hero. A veteran of World War Two and the Korean War who just turned 100-years-old, and his name is George Washington Perry…legit,” President Trump said. “George, thank you very much for being here, thank you George, 100-years-old.”

The campaign has also sent a cease and desist letter, calling the ad “a low-brow attempt to deceive the voters.”

Among his duties in the house, Hudson serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee as well as on sub-committees for health care, energy and digital privacy.

Hudson spoke on the latest efforts by the House to pass a needed spending bill. He noted a continuing resolution, which allowed spending to continue temporarily at current levels, was recently passed. That handcuffs the military, though, and doesn’t afford them the chance to start new programs or get needed funding increases, he said. It expires on Dec. 20.

“There’s no disagreement among Republicans that we’re going to repeal Obamacare.” Those are the words of Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC 08) in an exclusive appearance on the “What Matters in North Carolina” podcast on January 5, 2016.

Of course saying that Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced is just the starting point, but Hudson said it is a conversation that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) and President-elect Donald Trump began to have immediately following the election in November.

Caitlin Legacki, a spokeswoman for the PAC, raised the issue of proxy voting, pointing out that the House passed a measure in May and extended it until Aug. 18 to allow lawmakers to vote and take part in committee meetings remotely during the pandemic.

RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) — A campaign ad attacks U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson (R-North Carolina), for missing a vote on the annual spending bill for the U.S. Department of Defense.

The Hudson re-election campaign also says the congressman helped write the bill. In remarks to the House Armed Services Committee on July 20, U.S. Rep Trent Kelly, R-Mississippi, credited Hudson for the inclusion of a provision that increased hazardous duty pay by 10 percent — from $250 per month to $275 — for active-duty military members in eligible locations.

He is ranked as the 12th most conservative member of the House by the National Journal, he also carries another distinction according to one survey that dubbed him the “most effective North Carolina Congressman.”

“When we do continuing resolutions, in which we say keep spending at the same levels as last year, it’s devastating to the military,” Hudson said. “They can’t start new programs, they can’t buy new systems. It’s really bad news for our troops.”

As bright skies and warm temperatures evaporated lingering puddles on Tuesday, Rowan County’s two congressmen took time to learn how locals fared during the weekend storm.

“We had all these different departments here,” said Soliz as he showed the two men Rowan’s Emergency Operations Center, established to prepare for and respond to Hurricane Florence as it approached. “… In this situation, everybody dropped titles and we were all one team.”

Pelosi’s tweet inspired such anger because responsible gun owners believe their rights are being curtailed, even if they follow the concealed-carry rules — while violent criminals who want to have a gun are not going to be bothered with following such rules in the first place.

NAEMT will present Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC) with the 2017 EMS Legislator of the Year Award on April 25 during EMS On The Hill Day, the largest national advocacy event for emergency medical services (EMS) professionals.

Introduced by U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-NC, and 63 co-sponsors on the first day of session in the new House, Indiana Republican Trey Hollingsworth became the 150th lawmaker to lend his name to the measure last week.

During the interview, Hudson affirmed that the mood among his colleagues is in fact that repealing the monstrosity officially known as the Affordable Care Act is a priority. Hudson continued,

Pulling the rug out from under a massive law like the Affordable Care Act is ultimately not going to happen, as Hudson noted that the repeal that is likely to be on Trump’s desk in February will be a phased-in two or three-year repeal. Hudson said, “As Mike Pence said yesterday, we need to make sure we have an orderly transition so that we don’t disrupt markets, so that we don’t disrupt families. If there are folks out there that have health care through Obamacare they don’t need to have anxiety that they’re going to lose that coverage.”

“I’m running for reelection to continue to be a conservative, common sense voice for the people of North Carolina’s 8th District,” Hudson said. ”I’ve always been clear on my priorities for the district – creating an environment where folks can find good-paying jobs, rebuilding our military and being a voice for our veterans. I look forward to continuing to share our positive message from Cumberland to Cabarrus and everywhere in between.”

He quotes former North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms when speaking about the matter.

A day later — and a day before Hudson’s quarantine ended — the congressman entered into the Congressional Record a personal explanation to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, that says he would have voted in favor of the bill had he been present.

This prestigious award recognizes a member of Congress who demonstrates an outstanding commitment to, and support of, high quality prehospital and emergency medical care, as well as the EMS professionals who dutifully serve our nation’s patients.

Joining Congressman Hudson today were Concord City Councilman and veteran John Sweat, retired Army Sgt. Mike Verardo who was severely wounded in action as a member of the 82nd Airborne, Michelle Black, a Gold Star Spouse of 3rd Special Forces Group Sgt. Bryan Black who was killed in action in Tongo Tongo on Oct. 4, 2017, and Army Special Forces veteran John Zumwalt. Each speaker discussed Congressman Hudson’s record serving troops, their families and veterans.

We wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios but ultimately settled on Three because her last line — “the @HouseGOP just voted to do exactly that” — is so over the top and exaggerated. One can have a respectful political debate, raising the issue of a lower common denominator for concealed-weapons permits, without accusing the other side of voting to let violent criminals and stalkers have guns.

CBS 17 took a closer look at some of the key claims in the ad as part of our political pledge to test the factual accuracy of public communications offered by candidates, political action committees, or partisan groups.

Hudson says the ongoing impeachment inquiry by Democrats is hindering efforts to resolve other issues, just as important, if not more. He says the focus is preventing getting anything done.

“If healthcare workers, first responders, truck drivers, and grocery store clerks are on the job, lawmakers should be on the House floor voting,” he wrote.

“Serving as Fort Bragg’s Congressman is an honor and voters, as well as our troops, veterans and their families, deserve to know the truth about my record,” said Congressman Hudson. “Claims that I skipped out on pay raises for troops are lies and do not reflect my record of helping secure critical provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act to give troops a 10% raise, increase support for military family education, and expand access to the VA for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.”

A veteran from Kannapolis who recently celebrated his 100th birthday got some special recognition from Commander-In-Chief Donald Trump at a rally held in Charlotte on Monday night.

Hudson said that because of Senate rules attached to budget reconciliation bills, a repeal and full replacement of Obamacare cannot be done in the same legislation. Hudson said that there could be some replacement language in the form of expanding Health Savings Accounts.

“I think I demonstrate you can stand on principle,” he said. “But you can also reach across the aisle and get things done for the people.”

“We’re using this time to prepare, to build support, and when we get our window of opportunity later this year, we’re going to take it,” assured Hudson.

“We probably have more veterans in this part of the country than anywhere,” he said. “Then, I represent the largest Army base in the world, Fort Bragg, the epicenter of the universe, and that’s a big priority for me: making sure we’re giving those men and women everything they need to do their jobs well, get home safely and also take care of their families.”

Hudson, who serves on the House Energy Commerce Committee, said that the committee will start hearing before the end of the month on what a replacement to Obamacare will look like. Hudson said that HR 2300, which has been introduced the past three years is the basic blueprint for what replacement will look like.

Hudson added, “There will be a time period that we will have to put that new health care reform in place, before Obamacare goes away. But, Obamacare will be eliminated with that legislation that’s going to pass next month.” Ultimately Hudson said that they want to get it right, and have real conservative healthcare reform that will help people.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, along with 20 Republican members of Congress and four constituents, sued Pelosi in May over the practice, calling it unconstitutional and saying it dilutes members’ votes. Andrew says Hudson has joined the lawsuit.

THE FACTS: No one disputes that Hudson did not cast a vote on the National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 6395) over the summer.

Current 8th District Congressman Richard Hudson, who officially filed to re-gain his seat shortly after the new districts were declared valid, visited Dunn recently in an effort to bring awareness to residents of the pending changes to their representation. Hudson has served as the representative for the district since 2013.

“I’m going to represent my old district until January 3, 2021,” Hudson said. “I’ll be campaigning here, but if you need help with the federal government, I’m not legally allowed to help you until then. It’s going to be confusing for people because they’re going to see my ads and my signs thinking they can come to me, but I’m not really allowed to help them. But I can help direct people and we won’t turn anybody away.”

However, the tax penalties which have been so onerous to many Americans may be addressed in the repeal bill. Hudson said, “My hope is that you’ll see a zeroing out of those tax penalties.” Additionally, Hudson said that President Trump is set to begin unwinding Obamacare.

While ads being run on TV and mailed to voters claim Congressman Hudson “skipped a vote to give military families a much needed pay raise” and “turned his back on military families,” these ads fail to mention that Congressman Hudson wrote sections of the National Defense Authorization Act which awarded a pay raise to troops, a 10% increase in Hazardous Duty Pay, strengthened and expanded the Preservation of the Force and Family program for Special Forces, expanded the VA’s Burn Pit Registry for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits in Egypt and Syria, strengthened the Exceptional Family Member Program that supports special needs education for military families, and improved Impact Aid funding for education around military bases.

The University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University did a study on the subject and Hudson was rated as most effective among all Republicans and Democrats in the state.

Across the county, 264 storm-related phone calls have been recorded since the weather began late Friday. Most of these have addressed down power lines, trees and similar hazards.

Moore County, NC – Congressman Richard Hudson, Fort Bragg’s Congressman and candidate for North Carolina’s 8th Congressional District, was joined by veterans, military families and a Gold Star Spouse today for a virtual press conference to set the record straight on Congressman Hudson’s record of supporting troops, veterans and their families. Today’s announcement follows false and misleading advertisements from the House Majority Pac and DCCC on behalf of and by Congressman Hudson’s opponent, Patricia Timmons-Goodson claiming that Congressman Hudson “skipped out” on pay raises for troops. One ad run by Nancy Pelosi’s House Majority Pac, was deemed ‘mostly false’ by CBS 17.

Hudson defines himself as “a conservative, but common sense person who likes to get things done.”

A similar bill was sent to President Obama last year which he vetoed. Hudson said that the Senate will likely start the process with their bill next week, and that a bill could be on President Trump’s desk in February. But, the process is not as cut and dry as it may seem.

Hudson was under quarantine for COVID-19 concerns from July 9-23 after having contact with a person who tested positive for the disease. Hudson’s office provided CBS 17 with a letter from Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician for Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court, that outlines the specifics of his recommended 14-day quarantine.

“They’re so focused on that, we’re not getting things done like funding the government,” Hudson said. “There’s a lot of things we can agree on like funding infrastructure, like dealing with drug pricing. There’s so many things that we could be doing that Democrats and Republicans can agree on that the people here expect us to be doing, and that’s the frustration for me.”

The political tug of war over gerrymandering of congressional districts was settled on Dec. 2 by a North Carolina Appeals Court decision that leaves congressional districts as they were drawn by the Republican-led state legislature. That means a change for voters in most of Harnett, parts of Johnston, Lee, Moore and all of Cabarrus, Stanly, Montgomery and Cumberland counties, who now make-up the 8th U.S. Congressional District. It also means a new face will be representing most of those voters in Washington, D.C.

Last week, Rep. Richard Hudson, (R-08) helped Perry celebrate his 100th birthday and read that his only other wish was to meet President Trump.

But the ad, produced by the Democrats’ House Majority PAC, leaves out some critical context.

Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., joined NRATV’s Grant Stinchfield Wednesday to give an update on the push for national reciprocity: “We have 129 co-sponsors, including three Democrats. So, I feel like we’re moving along very well with it,” he said.

Hudson added that President Trump signed a photo for Buck while on Air Force One prior to the rally, and Buck was also able to fulfill his goal of meeting President Trump backstage.

There are procedural questions and issues that will have to be navigated in order to undo a law that has been in place for nearly seven years. Hudson said, “Right now it’s a matter of timing and sequence. What you’ll see is a bill move very quickly through the House and Senate to repeal Obamacare, using a budget process called reconciliation. This is a process that allows a vote that can’t be filibustered in the Senate, so 51 votes can pass it.”

Hudson said, “The basic components of it are, Health Savings Accounts, allowing insurance companies to compete across state lines, giving tax credits to individuals who buy insurance, transparency of cost so that you know what things cost before you go have a procedure, tort reform. These are all the things we’ll be doing and they’ll probably start as individual legislation.”

THE CLAIM: The ad says Hudson “skipped out on a vote to give our troops a hard-earned raise.”

Some 147 field reports have been collected by what Soliz called “field liaisons,” identifying areas with high flooding and other storm-related issues.

“The fact remains that Congressman Hudson did not ‘skip out’ on this bill or pay raises for troops, and this ad misleads the public about his record of helping to write this bill and support our military,” campaign spokesman Robert Andrews said.

Pelosi’s tweet focuses on a possible loophole in the law and then uses inflammatory language such as “inviting.”

Hudson said, “Vice-President-elect Mike Pence spoke to House Republicans yesterday, [Wednesday, January 4, 2016], and he told us that President Trump is going to start immediately through the executive order process, through the administrative process of replacing Obamacare and doing the things they can do. For example, having an HHS Secretary remove some of the restrictions on insurance companies on plans, some of the requirements they can do administratively, they’ll start that right away, as well.”

BY RICHARD HUDSON FOR CONGRESS ON 9 JANUARY 2017 IN NEWS REP. RICHARD HUDSON: “WE’RE GOING TO REPEAL OBAMACARE” “There’s no disagreement among Republicans that we’re going to repeal Obamacare.” Those are the words of Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC 08) in an exclusive appearance on the “What Matters in North Carolina” podcast on January 5, 2016. During the interview, Hudson affirmed that the mood among his colleagues is in fact that repealing the monstrosity officially known as the Affordable Care Act is a priority. Hudson continued, Of course saying that Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced is just the starting point, but Hudson said it is a conversation that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) and President-elect Donald Trump began to have immediately following the election in November. There are procedural questions and issues that will have to be navigated in order to undo a law that has been in place for nearly seven years. Hudson said, “Right now it’s a matter of timing and sequence.

Introduced by U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-NC, and 63 co-sponsors on the first day of session in the new House, Indiana Republican Trey Hollingsworth became the 150th lawmaker to lend his name to the measure last week. Hudson has taken to the airwaves repeatedly in the last several weeks to stump for his proposal and push back against what he sees as misinformation about his legislation. “It’s flat out false to say that this bill will arm criminals or increase gun violence,” wrote Hudson in an op-ed published in U.S. News on Feb. 1. “If a criminal with malice wants to get a gun, I can guarantee he or she isn’t worried about following the laws on the books. Unfortunately, we can’t change that. But we can ensure law-abiding citizens can legally carry concealed firearms to defend themselves.”

BY RICHARD HUDSON FOR CONGRESS ON 9 DECEMBER 2019 IN NEWS GERRYMANDERING DECISION WILL MEAN NEW HARNETT REPRESENTATIVE The political tug of war over gerrymandering of congressional districts was settled on Dec. 2 by a North Carolina Appeals Court decision that leaves congressional districts as they were drawn by the Republican-led state legislature. That means a change for voters in most of Harnett, parts of Johnston, Lee, Moore and all of Cabarrus, Stanly, Montgomery and Cumberland counties, who now make-up the 8th U.S. Congressional District. It also means a new face will be representing most of those voters in Washington, D.C. Current 8th District Congressman Richard Hudson, who officially filed to re-gain his seat shortly after the new districts were declared valid, visited Dunn recently in an effort to bring awareness to residents of the pending changes to their representation. Hudson has served as the representative for the district since 2013. “My philosophy is if I’m you’re a congressman, I need to know you and you need to know me,” Hudson said. “So, I got here as soon as I could.” Voters will have a bit of a foggy path to travel until the changes take effect. While voters in the re-drawn 8th district will choose their representative in the 2020 primary and general elections, the candidates chosen and eventually elected, won’t actually represent the new district until it becomes official in January of 2021. “I’m going to represent my old district until January 3, 2021,” Hudson said. “I’ll be campaigning here, but if you need help with the federal government, I’m not legally allowed to help you until then. It’s going to be confusing for people because they’re going to see my ads and my signs thinking they can come to me, but I’m not really allowed to help them. But I can help direct people and we won’t turn anybody away.” Hudson defines himself as “a conservative, but common sense person who likes to get things done.” He is ranked as the 12th most conservative member of the House by the National Journal, he also carries another distinction according to one survey that dubbed him the “most effective North Carolina Congressman.” The University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University did a study on the subject and Hudson was rated as most effective among all Republicans and Democrats in the state. “I think I demonstrate you can stand on principle,” he said. “But you can also reach across the aisle and get things done for the people.” Among his duties in the house, Hudson serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee as well as on sub-committees for health care, energy and digital privacy. As far as a primary focus currently, Hudson says veterans and the military are high on his list. Fort Bragg sits in the heart of his district. That fact, combined with the large number of veterans who have made North Carolina their home, has made Hudson want to focus on them and the issues concerning them, he says. “We probably have more veterans in this part of the country than anywhere,” he said. “Then, I represent the largest Army base in the world, Fort Bragg, the epicenter of the universe, and that’s a big priority for me: making sure we’re giving those men and women everything they need to do their jobs well, get home safely and also take care of their families.” Hudson spoke on the latest efforts by the House to pass a needed spending bill. He noted a continuing resolution, which allowed spending to continue temporarily at current levels, was recently passed. That handcuffs the military, though, and doesn’t afford them the chance to start new programs or get needed funding increases, he said. It expires on Dec. 20. “When we do continuing resolutions, in which we say keep spending at the same levels as last year, it’s devastating to the military,” Hudson said. “They can’t start new programs, they can’t buy new systems. It’s really bad news for our troops.” Hudson said the largest obstacle to get a new spending bill passed comes in the ongoing argument between Democrats and Republicans over funding President Donald Trump’s border wall. He said the stalemate has led to a lack of negotiation between the two sides. “The biggest sticking point is the Democrats in Washington refuse to give the President any money for the border wall,” Hudson said. “And if there’s no wiggle room there, there’s no negotiations. I don’t know how you get out of that.” He quotes former North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms when speaking about the matter. “At the end of the day you’ve got to compromise,” he said. “As Senator Jesse Helms, one of my heroes, used to say ‘I won’t compromise my principles, but I will compromise my preferences’ and at the end of the day you’ve got to be willing to compromise some of your preferences and come back and fight for more later.” Hudson says the ongoing impeachment inquiry by Democrats is hindering efforts to resolve other issues, just as important, if not more. He says the focus is preventing getting anything done. “They’re so focused on that, we’re not getting things done like funding the government,” Hudson said. “There’s a lot of things we can agree on like funding infrastructure, like dealing with drug pricing. There’s so many things that we could be doing that Democrats and Republicans can agree on that the people here expect us to be doing, and that’s the frustration for me.” After filing for reelection on Dec. 2, Hudson released a statement. “I’m running for reelection to continue to be a conservative, common sense voice for the people of North Carolina’s 8th District,” Hudson said. ”I’ve always been clear on my priorities for the district – creating an environment where folks can find good-paying jobs, rebuilding our military and being a voice for our veterans.

Federal law also already prohibits violent criminals, abusers and stalkers from having guns; the issue is that some states already have tougher laws than at the federal level that could be overridden by permits from more lenient states. Still, the differences among most states may loom larger in the gun debate than in reality.

BY RICHARD HUDSON FOR CONGRESS ON 22 OCTOBER 2020 IN NEWS FAKE NEWS ALERT: NANCY PELOSI CAUGHT LYING ABOUT RICHARD HUDSON RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) — A campaign ad attacks U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson (R-North Carolina), for missing a vote on the annual spending bill for the U.S. Department of Defense. Hudson is facing Democratic challenger Patricia Timmons-Goodson in the race in North Carolina’s 8th Congressional District. CBS 17 took a closer look at some of the key claims in the ad as part of our political pledge to test the factual accuracy of public communications offered by candidates, political action committees, or partisan groups. THE CLAIM: The ad says Hudson “skipped out on a vote to give our troops a hard-earned raise.” THE FACTS: No one disputes that Hudson did not cast a vote on the National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 6395) over the summer. But the ad, produced by the Democrats’ House Majority PAC, leaves out some critical context. Hudson was under quarantine for COVID-19 concerns from July 9-23 after having contact with a person who tested positive for the disease. Hudson’s office provided CBS 17 with a letter from Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician for Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court, that outlines the specifics of his recommended 14-day quarantine. The bill easily passed the House by a 295-125 vote on July 21. A day later — and a day before Hudson’s quarantine ended — the congressman entered into the Congressional Record a personal explanation to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, that says he would have voted in favor of the bill had he been present. “The fact remains that Congressman Hudson did not ‘skip out’ on this bill or pay raises for troops, and this ad misleads the public about his record of helping to write this bill and support our military,” campaign spokesman Robert Andrews said. The campaign has also sent a cease and desist letter, calling the ad “a low-brow attempt to deceive the voters.” Caitlin Legacki, a spokeswoman for the PAC, raised the issue of proxy voting, pointing out that the House passed a measure in May and extended it until Aug. 18 to allow lawmakers to vote and take part in committee meetings remotely during the pandemic. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, along with 20 Republican members of Congress and four constituents, sued Pelosi in May over the practice, calling it unconstitutional and saying it dilutes members’ votes. Andrew says Hudson has joined the lawsuit. In a statement posted May 31 on his Congressional website, Hudson said he would not vote by proxy. “If healthcare workers, first responders, truck drivers, and grocery store clerks are on the job, lawmakers should be on the House floor voting,” he wrote. The Hudson re-election campaign also says the congressman helped write the bill. In remarks to the House Armed Services Committee on July 20, U.S. Rep Trent Kelly, R-Mississippi, credited Hudson for the inclusion of a provision that increased hazardous duty pay by 10 percent — from $250 per month to $275 — for active-duty military members in eligible locations.

RICHARD HUDSON FOR CONGRESS

 <tag> p




But the reality is that most states already allow for reciprocity agreements with other states. Federal law also already prohibits violent criminals, abusers and stalkers from having guns; the issue is that some states already have tougher laws than at the federal level that could be overridden by permits from more lenient states. Still, the differences among most states may loom larger in the gun debate than in reality.

Hudson is facing Democratic challenger Patricia Timmons-Goodson in the race in North Carolina’s 8th Congressional District.

In a statement posted May 31 on his Congressional website, Hudson said he would not vote by proxy.

As far as a primary focus currently, Hudson says veterans and the military are high on his list. Fort Bragg sits in the heart of his district. That fact, combined with the large number of veterans who have made North Carolina their home, has made Hudson want to focus on them and the issues concerning them, he says.

“My philosophy is if I’m you’re a congressman, I need to know you and you need to know me,” Hudson said. “So, I got here as soon as I could.”

“At the end of the day you’ve got to compromise,” he said. “As Senator Jesse Helms, one of my heroes, used to say ‘I won’t compromise my principles, but I will compromise my preferences’ and at the end of the day you’ve got to be willing to compromise some of your preferences and come back and fight for more later.”

Hudson said the largest obstacle to get a new spending bill passed comes in the ongoing argument between Democrats and Republicans over funding President Donald Trump’s border wall. He said the stalemate has led to a lack of negotiation between the two sides.

CONCORD – U.S. Representative Richard Hudson (NC-08) today announced that his re-election campaign raised nearly $310,000 in the second quarter of 2017 with the vast majority of those donations coming from individuals in North Carolina. This is the second quarter in a row that he has raised over $300,000, bringing his total raised so far this cycle to $658,435.27.

“When I heard about George “Buck” Perry’s life of service and his 100th birthday last month, I was honored to enter remarks into the Congressional Record honoring his commitment to our nation during WWII,” Hudson said. “When I heard he had two wishes on his 100th birthday — to renew his drivers license one more time and to meet President Trump, I thought the timing couldn’t be more perfect since we had a rally scheduled for March 2nd. I’m proud to report mission accomplished.”

“The biggest sticking point is the Democrats in Washington refuse to give the President any money for the border wall,” Hudson said. “And if there’s no wiggle room there, there’s no negotiations. I don’t know how you get out of that.”

A remaining priority for Richard is dismantling the top-down, government-heavy approach of the Affordable Care Act. Richard has outlined his principles for reforming our health care laws—

The bill easily passed the House by a 295-125 vote on July 21.

After filing for reelection on Dec. 2, Hudson released a statement.

Voters will have a bit of a foggy path to travel until the changes take effect. While voters in the re-drawn 8th district will choose their representative in the 2020 primary and general elections, the candidates chosen and eventually elected, won’t actually represent the new district until it becomes official in January of 2021.

“We’re also honored tonight to be joined by a true American hero. A veteran of World War Two and the Korean War who just turned 100-years-old, and his name is George Washington Perry…legit,” President Trump said. “George, thank you very much for being here, thank you George, 100-years-old.”

The campaign has also sent a cease and desist letter, calling the ad “a low-brow attempt to deceive the voters.”

Among his duties in the house, Hudson serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee as well as on sub-committees for health care, energy and digital privacy.

Hudson spoke on the latest efforts by the House to pass a needed spending bill. He noted a continuing resolution, which allowed spending to continue temporarily at current levels, was recently passed. That handcuffs the military, though, and doesn’t afford them the chance to start new programs or get needed funding increases, he said. It expires on Dec. 20.

Hudson’s campaign has raised more money from North Carolina donors in the first six months of this year than in any previous year.

Caitlin Legacki, a spokeswoman for the PAC, raised the issue of proxy voting, pointing out that the House passed a measure in May and extended it until Aug. 18 to allow lawmakers to vote and take part in committee meetings remotely during the pandemic.

RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) — A campaign ad attacks U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson (R-North Carolina), for missing a vote on the annual spending bill for the U.S. Department of Defense.

The Hudson re-election campaign also says the congressman helped write the bill. In remarks to the House Armed Services Committee on July 20, U.S. Rep Trent Kelly, R-Mississippi, credited Hudson for the inclusion of a provision that increased hazardous duty pay by 10 percent — from $250 per month to $275 — for active-duty military members in eligible locations.

He is ranked as the 12th most conservative member of the House by the National Journal, he also carries another distinction according to one survey that dubbed him the “most effective North Carolina Congressman.”

“When we do continuing resolutions, in which we say keep spending at the same levels as last year, it’s devastating to the military,” Hudson said. “They can’t start new programs, they can’t buy new systems. It’s really bad news for our troops.”

As bright skies and warm temperatures evaporated lingering puddles on Tuesday, Rowan County’s two congressmen took time to learn how locals fared during the weekend storm.

“We had all these different departments here,” said Soliz as he showed the two men Rowan’s Emergency Operations Center, established to prepare for and respond to Hurricane Florence as it approached. “… In this situation, everybody dropped titles and we were all one team.”

Pelosi’s tweet inspired such anger because responsible gun owners believe their rights are being curtailed, even if they follow the concealed-carry rules — while violent criminals who want to have a gun are not going to be bothered with following such rules in the first place.

“The generous support of my fellow North Carolinians means so much to me,” said Hudson. “It shows that the work we are doing to fight for commonsense, conservative values is really resonating with the folks at home, and they believe in our efforts.”

NAEMT will present Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC) with the 2017 EMS Legislator of the Year Award on April 25 during EMS On The Hill Day, the largest national advocacy event for emergency medical services (EMS) professionals.

This is why he wrote the Care Veterans Deserve Act, a bill designed to increase and enhance access to outside providers from the VA. This bill was used as a foundation for the VA MISSION Act, a bill signed into law by Donald Trump that reformed the VA’s health care system and enhanced access to outside providers for veterans.

“I’m running for reelection to continue to be a conservative, common sense voice for the people of North Carolina’s 8th District,” Hudson said. ”I’ve always been clear on my priorities for the district – creating an environment where folks can find good-paying jobs, rebuilding our military and being a voice for our veterans. I look forward to continuing to share our positive message from Cumberland to Cabarrus and everywhere in between.”

He quotes former North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms when speaking about the matter.

A day later — and a day before Hudson’s quarantine ended — the congressman entered into the Congressional Record a personal explanation to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, that says he would have voted in favor of the bill had he been present.

This prestigious award recognizes a member of Congress who demonstrates an outstanding commitment to, and support of, high quality prehospital and emergency medical care, as well as the EMS professionals who dutifully serve our nation’s patients.

Joining Congressman Hudson today were Concord City Councilman and veteran John Sweat, retired Army Sgt. Mike Verardo who was severely wounded in action as a member of the 82nd Airborne, Michelle Black, a Gold Star Spouse of 3rd Special Forces Group Sgt. Bryan Black who was killed in action in Tongo Tongo on Oct. 4, 2017, and Army Special Forces veteran John Zumwalt. Each speaker discussed Congressman Hudson’s record serving troops, their families and veterans.

We wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios but ultimately settled on Three because her last line — “the @HouseGOP just voted to do exactly that” — is so over the top and exaggerated. One can have a respectful political debate, raising the issue of a lower common denominator for concealed-weapons permits, without accusing the other side of voting to let violent criminals and stalkers have guns.

CBS 17 took a closer look at some of the key claims in the ad as part of our political pledge to test the factual accuracy of public communications offered by candidates, political action committees, or partisan groups.

Hudson says the ongoing impeachment inquiry by Democrats is hindering efforts to resolve other issues, just as important, if not more. He says the focus is preventing getting anything done.

“If healthcare workers, first responders, truck drivers, and grocery store clerks are on the job, lawmakers should be on the House floor voting,” he wrote.

“Serving as Fort Bragg’s Congressman is an honor and voters, as well as our troops, veterans and their families, deserve to know the truth about my record,” said Congressman Hudson. “Claims that I skipped out on pay raises for troops are lies and do not reflect my record of helping secure critical provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act to give troops a 10% raise, increase support for military family education, and expand access to the VA for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.”

A veteran from Kannapolis who recently celebrated his 100th birthday got some special recognition from Commander-In-Chief Donald Trump at a rally held in Charlotte on Monday night.

Concerned about the rising cost of health coverage and health care, Richard has led the charge to reform our broken health care system. As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the committee charged with writing most of our nation’s health care laws, Richard has distinguished himself as a leader in health care who will pursue bipartisan solutions to the most pressing issues.

Reps. Richard Hudson, R-8, and Ted Budd, R-13, were briefed on county impacts by Chief of Emergency Services Chris Soliz.

“I think I demonstrate you can stand on principle,” he said. “But you can also reach across the aisle and get things done for the people.”

“We probably have more veterans in this part of the country than anywhere,” he said. “Then, I represent the largest Army base in the world, Fort Bragg, the epicenter of the universe, and that’s a big priority for me: making sure we’re giving those men and women everything they need to do their jobs well, get home safely and also take care of their families.”

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, along with 20 Republican members of Congress and four constituents, sued Pelosi in May over the practice, calling it unconstitutional and saying it dilutes members’ votes. Andrew says Hudson has joined the lawsuit.

THE FACTS: No one disputes that Hudson did not cast a vote on the National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 6395) over the summer.

Current 8th District Congressman Richard Hudson, who officially filed to re-gain his seat shortly after the new districts were declared valid, visited Dunn recently in an effort to bring awareness to residents of the pending changes to their representation. Hudson has served as the representative for the district since 2013.

“I’m going to represent my old district until January 3, 2021,” Hudson said. “I’ll be campaigning here, but if you need help with the federal government, I’m not legally allowed to help you until then. It’s going to be confusing for people because they’re going to see my ads and my signs thinking they can come to me, but I’m not really allowed to help them. But I can help direct people and we won’t turn anybody away.”

While ads being run on TV and mailed to voters claim Congressman Hudson “skipped a vote to give military families a much needed pay raise” and “turned his back on military families,” these ads fail to mention that Congressman Hudson wrote sections of the National Defense Authorization Act which awarded a pay raise to troops, a 10% increase in Hazardous Duty Pay, strengthened and expanded the Preservation of the Force and Family program for Special Forces, expanded the VA’s Burn Pit Registry for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits in Egypt and Syria, strengthened the Exceptional Family Member Program that supports special needs education for military families, and improved Impact Aid funding for education around military bases.

The University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University did a study on the subject and Hudson was rated as most effective among all Republicans and Democrats in the state.

Across the county, 264 storm-related phone calls have been recorded since the weather began late Friday. Most of these have addressed down power lines, trees and similar hazards.

Moore County, NC – Congressman Richard Hudson, Fort Bragg’s Congressman and candidate for North Carolina’s 8th Congressional District, was joined by veterans, military families and a Gold Star Spouse today for a virtual press conference to set the record straight on Congressman Hudson’s record of supporting troops, veterans and their families. Today’s announcement follows false and misleading advertisements from the House Majority Pac and DCCC on behalf of and by Congressman Hudson’s opponent, Patricia Timmons-Goodson claiming that Congressman Hudson “skipped out” on pay raises for troops. One ad run by Nancy Pelosi’s House Majority Pac, was deemed ‘mostly false’ by CBS 17.

Hudson defines himself as “a conservative, but common sense person who likes to get things done.”

Hudson was under quarantine for COVID-19 concerns from July 9-23 after having contact with a person who tested positive for the disease. Hudson’s office provided CBS 17 with a letter from Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician for Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court, that outlines the specifics of his recommended 14-day quarantine.

“They’re so focused on that, we’re not getting things done like funding the government,” Hudson said. “There’s a lot of things we can agree on like funding infrastructure, like dealing with drug pricing. There’s so many things that we could be doing that Democrats and Republicans can agree on that the people here expect us to be doing, and that’s the frustration for me.”

The political tug of war over gerrymandering of congressional districts was settled on Dec. 2 by a North Carolina Appeals Court decision that leaves congressional districts as they were drawn by the Republican-led state legislature. That means a change for voters in most of Harnett, parts of Johnston, Lee, Moore and all of Cabarrus, Stanly, Montgomery and Cumberland counties, who now make-up the 8th U.S. Congressional District. It also means a new face will be representing most of those voters in Washington, D.C.

Richard believes the Veterans Administration should honor its promise to our nation’s veterans—to care for the soldier who has endured battle. Richard fights every day he’s in Washington to hold the VA’s bureaucracy accountable and get rid of the red tape that prevents the hardworking men and women of the VA in Salisbury and Fayetteville from doing their jobs.

Last week, Rep. Richard Hudson, (R-08) helped Perry celebrate his 100th birthday and read that his only other wish was to meet President Trump.

Richard also believes that veterans should not be denied access to care because the Washington bureaucracy at the VA is getting in the way. He has long championed supplementing care at the VA with access to outside providers to ease congestion. He has never advocated for privatizing the VA as he believes veterans should have access to a health care system that can cater to their unique needs, but he does believe veterans should never be delayed in accessing care.

But the ad, produced by the Democrats’ House Majority PAC, leaves out some critical context.

Hudson’s July 15 Second Quarter Report, filed Friday with the Federal Election Commission shows that during the period between April 1, 2017 and June 30, 2017, Congressman Hudson raised a total of $309,350.91. Over 86% of Congressman Hudson’s individual contributions came from North Carolina.

Hudson added that President Trump signed a photo for Buck while on Air Force One prior to the rally, and Buck was also able to fulfill his goal of meeting President Trump backstage.

THE CLAIM: The ad says Hudson “skipped out on a vote to give our troops a hard-earned raise.”

Some 147 field reports have been collected by what Soliz called “field liaisons,” identifying areas with high flooding and other storm-related issues.

“The fact remains that Congressman Hudson did not ‘skip out’ on this bill or pay raises for troops, and this ad misleads the public about his record of helping to write this bill and support our military,” campaign spokesman Robert Andrews said.

Pelosi’s tweet focuses on a possible loophole in the law and then uses inflammatory language such as “inviting.”

Richard Hudson (R-North Carolina), for missing a vote on the annual spending bill for the U.S. Department of Defense. Hudson is facing Democratic challenger Patricia Timmons-Goodson in the race in North Carolina’s 8th Congressional District. CBS 17 took a closer look at some of the key claims in the ad as part of our political pledge to test the factual accuracy of public communications offered by candidates, political action committees, or partisan groups. THE CLAIM: The ad says Hudson “skipped out on a vote to give our troops a hard-earned raise.” THE FACTS: No one disputes that Hudson did not cast a vote on the National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 6395) over the summer. But the ad, produced by the Democrats’ House Majority PAC, leaves out some critical context. Hudson was under quarantine for COVID-19 concerns from July 9-23 after having contact with a person who tested positive for the disease. Hudson’s office provided CBS 17 with a letter from Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician for Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court, that outlines the specifics of his recommended 14-day quarantine. The bill easily passed the House by a 295-125 vote on July 21. A day later — and a day before Hudson’s quarantine ended — the congressman entered into the Congressional Record a personal explanation to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, that says he would have voted in favor of the bill had he been present. “The fact remains that Congressman Hudson did not ‘skip out’ on this bill or pay raises for troops, and this ad misleads the public about his record of helping to write this bill and support our military,” campaign spokesman Robert Andrews said. The campaign has also sent a cease and desist letter, calling the ad “a low-brow attempt to deceive the voters.” Caitlin Legacki, a spokeswoman for the PAC, raised the issue of proxy voting, pointing out that the House passed a measure in May and extended it until Aug. 18 to allow lawmakers to vote and take part in committee meetings remotely during the pandemic. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, along with 20 Republican members of Congress and four constituents, sued Pelosi in May over the practice, calling it unconstitutional and saying it dilutes members’ votes. Andrew says Hudson has joined the lawsuit. In a statement posted May 31 on his Congressional website, Hudson said he would not vote by proxy. “If healthcare workers, first responders, truck drivers, and grocery store clerks are on the job, lawmakers should be on the House floor voting,” he wrote. The Hudson re-election campaign also says the congressman helped write the bill. In remarks to the House Armed Services Committee on July 20, U.S. Rep Trent Kelly, R-Mississippi, credited Hudson for the inclusion of a provision that increased hazardous duty pay by 10 percent — from $250 per month to $275 — for active-duty military members in eligible locations.

The 7th generation of his family to live and work in the 8th District, Richard learned about hard work from his father, working construction jobs from an early age and waiting tables to help himself through college. He learned about public service from his mother, a retired Cabarrus County public school teacher. Throughout his professional career, Richard has drawn upon these lessons to get results for the people he has served.

Richard’s past volunteer leadership service includes membership on the Rowan-Cabarrus Community College Board of Trustees, Board of Governors of the UNC Charlotte Alumni Association, Board of Managers of the West Cabarrus YMCA and Board of Directors of the Cabarrus Jaycees. Richard is also an avid hunter and outdoorsman.

Since he was elected in 2012, Richard Hudson has worked hard to serve North Carolina’s 8th Congressional District, which includes all or part of 7 counties spanning from Salisbury and Concord across South-Central North Carolina to Cumberland County.

Richard was born in Franklin, Virginia on November 4, 1971. From age four, Richard was raised in North Carolina and graduated from Myers Park High School in Charlotte. He then attended UNC Charlotte, serving as Student Body President before receiving his Bachelor of Arts in History and Political Science.

As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Richard is working to cut federal spending, replace Obamacare with a health care system that puts patients first, and go after all sources of American energy to lower costs for everyone and spur job creation.

In 2012, National Journal recognized Richard as a “rising star” in Congress. Richard is the most effective legislator from North Carolina according to the Center for Effective Lawmaking. Also, he was named the 12th most conservative Member of the House for always standing up for traditional values that protect our 2nd Amendment rights, reduce taxes, rein in Washington’s wasteful spending and help create jobs in North Carolina.

Richard also serves as Chairman of the Agriculture Policy Group under the Republican Policy Committee where he works to advance conservative reforms that empower North Carolina’s growers, producers, and agribusiness leaders to thrive.
