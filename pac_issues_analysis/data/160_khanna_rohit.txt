I

played a critical role in securing a $330,000 grant from the federal government for Fremont to find new uses for the abandoned auto plant, in addition to funds for job training programs to help the skilled workers who found themselves out of work and with nowhere to turn.

Congressman Ro Khanna, 44, is a Representative of California’s 17th District in the 117th Congress.

Following my mother’s example, I was a Lecturer in the Department of Economics at Stanford University and an Adjunct Professor at Santa Clara Law School.

In 2009, President Obama appointed me to serve as Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce.

info@rokhanna.com | Press1@rokhanna.com | © Ro for Congress

Following my mother’s example, I was a Lecturer in the Department of Economics at Stanford University and an Adjunct Professor at Santa Clara Law School. Governor Jerry Brown appointed me to the California Workforce Development Board for the State of California, where I served as chair for the Advanced Manufacturing Committee. I also served on the Board of Directors of Planned Parenthood Mar Monte and have tutored local Irvington High School students in my spare time. My pro bono legal activity includes work with the Mississippi Center for Justice on several contractor fraud cases on behalf of Hurricane Katrina victims.

.

My committment to service is rooted in the belief that the American Dream that inspired his family should continue to inspire future generations.

My commitment to public service was inspired early on by my grandfather, who told me stories about participating in Gandhi’s independence movement in India and spending several years in jail for promoting human rights. Somewhat serendipitously, I first became involved in politics while attending the University of Chicago, where he worked on the campaign of a little-known candidate for state Senate named Barack Obama. Later, I worked on Obama’s presidential campaign. In 2003, I ran a protest campaign for Congress in California against a Democratic incumbent who voted for George W. Bush’s decision to attack Iraq. Although I lost badly, I was one of the first anti-Iraq war campaigns in the nation. My principled stand was not about receiving political endorsements, or working within the establishment, but about standing up for my beliefs.

Congressman Ro Khanna, 44, is a Representative of California’s 17th District in the 117th Congress.

Like so many families in our area, my parents immigrated to the United States—coming from India to seek opportunity and a better life for their children. I was born in Philadelphia in 1976, and learned the value of education and hard work from my parents. My father studied engineering at the University of Michigan; my mother was a substitute teacher. I benefited from a quality public school education and took out student loans to attend great universities, which I am still paying off today. I graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in economics from the University of Chicago, and received a law degree from Yale University.

After leaving the Commerce Department, I authored a book on the state of American manufacturing and how to keep it competitive in the global economy. Entrepreneurial Nation: Why Manufacturing is Still Key to America's Future has won widespread praise for its strategies to keep the best companies, jobs, and opportunities in America.

I have been a strong advocate for local issues in our community. I have worked with Milpitas Mayor Jose Esteves to reduce odor from the Newby Landfill and to hold Republic accountable. I have also worked with Santa Clara Mayor Lisa Gillmor to make sure the San Francisco 49ers did not take over the Youth Soccer Park in Santa Clara. I have worked with environmentalists to stand up to Lehigh Cement Plant and insist that the plant be held to modern day envionmental standards.

In 2009, President Obama appointed me to serve as Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce. I broke new ground when I organized clean technology trade missions and expanded the Green Embassy program, which allows American clean technology firms to showcase their products in our embassies overseas. I also served on the White House Business Council, working with both business and labor for policies that promote to bring back American manufacturing jobs. Under my leadership, American exports grew dramatically. I received a letter of commendation for my service from Frank Sanchez, Under Secretary for International Trade.

In 2009 and 2010, I took the lead on defending the rights of workers who were being laid off by New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI) as the plant closed its doors in Fremont. I played a critical role in securing a $330,000 grant from the federal government for Fremont to find new uses for the abandoned auto plant, in addition to funds for job training programs to help the skilled workers who found themselves out of work and with nowhere to turn. My strong commitment to the United Auto Workers and the working families in the region is something that I bring to Congress as I advocate for a collaborative working relationship between organized labor and business leaders.

Paid for by Ro for Congress PO Box 3513, Santa Clara, CA, 95051

I was first elected to Congress in the 2016 general election, and am one of only six members of Congress who does not accept PAC contributions, continuing my efforts to keep politics and special interest money separate. I serve as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment, a member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, the Committee on Agriculture, and the Committee on Armed Services. In Congress, I serve as a strong voice for a progressive vision that promotes good jobs and wages for the 17th district and the United States of America.
