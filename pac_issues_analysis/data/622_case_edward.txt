Aloha, Friend! I am deeply honored and privileged to represent Hawaii’s great First Congressional District (Honolulu from Makapu’u to Mililani and Ko Olina) in the U. S. House of Representatives. My mission is to (1) provide strong effective national leadership on the critical issues of our times, (2) assure that Hawaii’s voice is heard and needs are addressed in Washington, D.C., and (3) stay in close touch with my constituents and assist with their individual concerns. I devote the sum total of my lifetime in Hawai’i, my decades in the public and private sectors, and my current office including membership on the House Appropriations and Natural Resources Committees to fulfilling these obligations. But I also bring a conviction that we must find a better way forward for our country. One that meets rather than creates or worsens our challenges. That celebrates our progress while acknowledging the road still ahead to truly fulfill our promise. That looks to our core values to ground us in the belief that we can and will do this together. The health, economic and social crisis of COVID-19 has only heightened the necessity of this better path.

Aloha, Friend!

But victory is just a moment in time, past now, while the great responsibility and obligation that it brings are constant. That all just started last night, and we leave for DC in a few days to begin the task of helping find a better way forward for our country and contributing to a strong voice for our Hawai’i on Capitol Hill.

I believe in knowing all of my district and staying in touch with all of the folks I represent.

That’s why in the recent primary election I did Walk the First, personally walking 62 miles right across our First Congressional District from Makapu’u through Honolulu up to Mililani Mauka and then back down through Waipahu, Ewa and Kapolei to Kahe. (more)

Mahalo!

From the bottom of my heart, mahalo!

That’s why, in my prior service in Congress, I did 172 Talk Story with Congressman Ed Case town hall meetings throughout Hawaii’s Second Congressional District and with our servicemembers overseas.

Gratitude to the voters of Hawaii’s great First Congressional District for advancing me to the general election. You carefully considered my candidacy, weighed your choice among strong candidates, and made your call. (more)
