GET IN TOUCH

Florida’s 23rd Congressional District is currently occupied by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was first elected in 2004 (in the 20th District). She is the definition of a career politician who has virtually no experience in issues that we all face everyday in our jobs, business and communities. She has put politics above people, she has worked for the powerful not the people, she has sowed division not unity. She has failed us ALL.

"We must always protect our most vulnerable, especially our children and the elderly.” - Carla Spalding

Whether you have an interest in politics is not as important as how politics will affect the life of you and your loved ones. This is not the time to sit idle on the sideline... we need your help, get involved. JOIN US NOW

I served in the military to protect our great citizens, then I served as a VA and Registered Nurse to protect our sick. I’m now running for Congress, so I can continue to serve YOU. You should be the priority, not foreign governments.
