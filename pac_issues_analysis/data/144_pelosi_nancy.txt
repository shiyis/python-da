Marjorie Taylor Greene – the far-right firebrand who has a penchant for spewing gross conspiracy theories – woke up “laughing” this morning after the People’s House held her accountable for promoting hate and ridiculing victims of gun violence. On Gun Violence Survivors Week, groups and leaders in the movement took notice: Marjorie Taylor Greene woke […]

Americans are hurting. Millions have lost their jobs and more than 450,000 have died in the U.S. from COVID-19. The days of going on “pause” are over. This is why Democrats, led by President Biden, are taking bold action which is widely supported by people across the country: 68% support the Biden-Harris Administration’s American Rescue […]

Women should take strength from their lived experience, both positive and negative, as they make plans for their future. That’s the message Nancy Pelosi delivered to youth poet laureate Amanda Gorman during a virtual Q&A Monday in honor of International Women’s Day, Deadline reported.

In a conversation moderated by Amanda Gorman, the current House speaker and former secretary of state also talked about how to bring more women into politics and navigating male-dominated work environments: “We have to have each other’s backs.”

Thanks to the great work of our VIPs – our Volunteers In Politics – we will celebrate 100 days of the Biden-Harris Administration this week! Join us *tonight* to discuss our significant progress in the fight to save lives and livelihoods! #HelpIsHere https://t.co/40eNS1QPmc https://t.co/wL1xUccLuC

Democrats are delivering results #ForThePeople: 200 million vaccine shots in arms in fewer than 100 days; money in people’s pockets, including tax credits to cut child poverty in half; and help to get covered! Join us tonight! RSVP here: https://t.co/BUcRk0ouDX https://t.co/sDujzkqzph

The Republican Party turned away from meeting the needs of America’s working families long ago. Blocking covid relief was just more obvious this time. They know the American people noticed so they are doubling down on voter suppression. We are fighting back #ForThePeople.

Instead of changing their morally bankrupt agenda that was rejected by voters in 2020, Republicans keep attacking voting rights and trying to pick their voters instead of voters picking who wins. Democrats are pushing back on their attacks to safeguard democracy #ForThePeople.

In recent months, Native American communities have done a great job is getting vaccines into arms but they are still recovering from the devastation from covid. #HelpIsHere with historic investment to address the vulnerabilities exposed in the pandemic. https://t.co/6FkwQzllbC

Pres. Biden’s promise of 200 million vaccine doses in arms in 100 days was kept with days to spare because of the confidence and cooperation of the American people. Follow the science and carry through fully on a plan to get vaccinated. #HelpIsHere https://t.co/f7Bixaqwi2

Fighting for America’s Hardworking Families

 <tag> p


Shattering the marble ceiling and making her the highest-ranking female politician in American history, Pelosi is the first woman to twice serve as the Speaker of the House. She has led House Democrats for more than 12 years and has represented San Francisco, California’s 12th District, for over 30 years. In 2013, she was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame.

Nancy Pelosi is the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives for the 117th Congress. As the top Democrat in the House, Pelosi is fighting to address the needs of working families and protect America from the dangerous agenda of Donald Trump and Kevin McCarthy.

Congressional scholar Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute described the 111th Congress under Pelosi’s leadership as “one of the most productive Congresses in history.” Thomas Mann, a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution, said “she’s probably gained the reputation as of one of the strongest and most effective speakers in decades.”

Working with President Barack Obama, Pelosi led Congress in one of the most successful legislative sessions in decades. Among her major accomplishments as Speaker of the House, Pelosi passed: historic health insurance reform legislation which established a Patients’ Bill of Rights and is providing coverage for more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans; the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which created and saved millions of American jobs; strong Wall Street reforms to rein in big banks and protect consumers; and key investments in higher education through the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which expands educational opportunities and reforms the financial aid system to save billions of taxpayers’ dollars.

Working with President Joe Biden, Speaker Pelosi led the passage of the overwhelmingly popular American Rescue Plan, which crushes the virus by putting vaccines in people’s arms, money in their pockets and children safely back in school.

Pelosi comes from a family with a long tradition of public service. Her late father, Thomas D’Alesandro Jr., served as Mayor of Baltimore for 12 years. Her brother, Thomas D’Alesandro III, also served as Mayor of Baltimore. She and her husband, Paul Pelosi, have five children and nine grandchildren. Pelosi has served in a number of positions within the Democratic Party including Chair of the California Democratic Party and Chair of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.

Nancy Fighting Back:

A Better Deal on Prescription Drugs

 <tag> p


Not long ago, American children and families were often denied coverage for having a pre-existing condition, millions were job-locked by their need for health coverage, and insurers could charge a woman higher premiums just for being a woman.

A Better Deal on Prescription Drugs

Leader Pelosi and Democrats offer Americans A Better Deal to reduce the cost of prescription drugs by cracking down on pharmaceutical price gouging that increases consumers’ drug prices for no reason, giving Medicare Part D the ability to negotiate lower drug prices, and ensuring real transparency for excessive drop price increases.

Nancy Fighting Back:

We believe seniors deserve a dignified retirement. As Leader of the House Democrats, Nancy is fighting to strengthen and protect Social Security and Medicare from Donald Trump and House Republicans’ fixation with destroying these vital pillars of retirement security.

While Republicans cynically work to sabotage American’s health care and dismantle the Affordable Care Act, Democrats will continue working to protect and improve this historic law and strengthen coverage for the American people.

Not anymore. That has all changed. Led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrats – who believe that health care is a right for all Americans, not a privilege for the few – spearheaded the passage of the historic Affordable Care Act in 2010 that has brought about health progress for our people:

Americans across the country are suffering from the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. They deserve better than a Republican Congress that would have made prescription drugs even harder to afford with the cruel cost increases of Trumpcare.

More than 5 million seniors have saved over $3 billion on the crippling cost of prescription drugs;

Democrats also helped graduate students with their loans by slashing Stafford loan interest rates in half – from 6.7% to 3.4% – in addition to creating an income-based repayment program and establishing a loan forgiveness program for graduates who embark in public interest careers.

Student Loans, Childhood Learning and Teachers:

Nancy Fighting Back:

In America, over 40 million people are saddled by $1.3 trillion in student loan debt. This has to change. Nancy believes students across California and the U.S. deserve the right to refinance this crushing economic ordeal at reasonable and affordable rates through the Bank On Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act.

Education is fundamental to the strength of our democracy and country. It is key to ensuring people in America are equipped and prepared to succeed in an ever-changing global economy. As Nancy has said time and again: nothing brings more money to the Department of Treasury than investing in education – early childhood, K-12, higher education, post graduate, and lifetime learning.

Nancy has fought tirelessly to secure federal resources to help save San Francisco City College. Under her leadership, Democrats worked to strengthen federal safeguards in order to maintain high standards and promote equal opportunity for historically disadvantaged kids through the Every Student Succeeds Act. Because of the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act that passed under her speakership, students in California and across the country have been able to pursue a higher education thanks to the creation of the American Opportunity Tax Credit and thanks to the maximum amount increase in Pell Grants, which remain under Republican assaults.

Nancy also knows more must be done so children and students are able compete in the 21st century. That is why she is fighting to increase access to effective early childhood learning. At the same time, our teachers – who give their all – must be provided with the necessary resources and funding in order to ensure our future leaders stand ready to face the challenges of tomorrow.

Immigration

Nancy Fighting Back

 <tag> p


Democrats continue to champion a bipartisan solution that will grant our brave DREAMers the opportunity to live in and continue contributing to the only country they love and call home. While the GOP demonizes hard-working immigrant families, Leader Pelosi and Democrats won’t stop fighting for comprehensive immigration reform.

Nancy Fighting Back:

Our nation is one made up of immigrants from all parts of the world. Every newcomer, who brings their dreams, optimism and aspiration, contributes to our social, economic and political fabric – making America more American. Under Republican control of Washington, immigrants face an anti-immigrant agenda that instills fear and tears families apart.

LGBT

Under the Speakership of Nancy Pelosi, Democrats passed the Lilly Ledbetter Act which was the first bill signed into law by President Barack Obama. Democrats know that when women succeed, America succeeds — and we continue to fight to end the injustice of the gender wage gap with the Paycheck Fairness Act, provide affordable child care through Democrats’ A Better Deal, and grant much-needed paid sick leave for working parents. We will continue to fight to end harassment, abuse and discrimination against women in every sector of our society

Veterans

Immigration

Just as the military leaves no soldier behind on the battlefield, as Democrats and elected officials, we will leave no veteran behind when they return home. Under my Speakership, Democrats were proud to have passed the largest increases in veterans’ funding; spearheaded educational opportunities for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and their spouses and children with the Post 9/11 GI Bill; fought veteran homelessness and Republican efforts to privatize the VA and profit from veterans’ health care; and so much more. We will continue to stand with and protect veterans and their families who’ve defended our country, our democracy and our ideals.

Women

People in the United States of America have the right to live with dignity and respect. And it is on us as a people, and on elected representatives of the people, to ensure that sacred right is fiercely defended – no matter one’s race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, ability, sexual orientation or gender identity.

From repealing ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” to passing the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, Democrats have made much-needed progress toward ending discrimination against the LGBT community. But more must be done to achieve full equality under the law. That is why with Democrats will continue fighting for the Equality Act and ensure our courageous transgender troops are protected from Trump’s misguided policies that punishes people for who they are.

 <tag> p


Democrats are proposing an Internet users’ Bill of Rights that will grant internet privacy rules for all. We will ensure a free and open internet through net neutrality rules that spur fair competition and do not punish small businesses. We will also ensure every community – urban, suburban and rural – has equal access to high speed internet.

Nancy Fighting Back:

Net neutrality is the foundation of the dynamism and success of the internet. But Republicans have dismantled net neutrality, and consistently worked to roll back your right to privacy on the internet. House Republicans even voted to allow internet service providers to sell your private browsing history and intimate personal information to anyone with the money to buy it.

With their assaults on the freedom and privacy of the internet, Republicans have pushed forward an anti-consumer, anti-competition agenda that will hurt America’s small businesses, families and economy.

We will continue fighting to ensure our children and their children inherit a world in which the air they breathe is clean of toxins and the water they drink is safe for their health by pushing for policies that protect our planet and bring about good-paying, clean energy jobs.

We cannot afford Republicans’ willful special interest blindness to the climate crisis. With rising temperatures, surging seas and record floods, fires and storms, real American leadership is needed now more than ever. But Republicans are busy stacking the deck for big polluters against the health of our children and our communities.

Nancy Fighting Back:

That is why Democrats are fighting Trump and his cabinet’s reckless decision to leave the Paris Climate Agreement in which nations of the world came together to combat the climate crisis. Meanwhile, Republicans have accelerated their assault on our environment – with a dirty energy agenda that harms God’s creation by weakening critical clean air and clean water protections, auctions off our public lands, and enriches polluters and Big Oil.

 <tag> p


The coronavirus is surging, the recovery is flagging, and the economy desperately needs more stimulus. Put the blame squarely on President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for the fact that help hasn’t arrived. It makes no sense to blame House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Two weeks ago, the House passed a $2.2 trillion package […]

Speaker Nancy Pelosi once predicted she’d have the 2020 House Democratic majority secured by November — of 2019. Now, days before the Nov. 3 election, she seems to have done it, and she’s expanding her reach. With control of the House hardly contested, Pelosi is working to fortify Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and win […]

Marjorie Taylor Greene – the far-right firebrand who has a penchant for spewing gross conspiracy theories – woke up “laughing” this morning after the People’s House held her accountable for promoting hate and ridiculing victims of gun violence. On Gun Violence Survivors Week, groups and leaders in the movement took notice: Marjorie Taylor Greene woke […]

For Immediate Release: November 4, 2020 Contact: Jorge Aguilar, aguilar@pelosiforcongress.com Pelosi Statement on Election Day Washington, D.C. – Speaker Nancy Pelosi made the following press statement on Tuesday evening: Speaker Pelosi. Madam Chair, good evening. Chair Bustos. Good evening. Speaker Pelosi. Good evening. You can’t – I can see you, but I’m sure you don’t […]

Unity is struggling to make headway in the House GOP. From self-destruction that will be “felt for years to come” to an abdication of leadership, it’s been a terribly awful month for Kevin McCarthy and the House Republican Conference controlled by QAnon. But don’t take our word for it. New York Times: Post Trump, Republicans Are Headed […]

Nancy Pelosi may be the most powerful congressional leader in modern U.S. history. In the 22 months since she’s returned to the speaker’s chair — an enormous achievement in itself — Pelosi has centralized power in an unprecedented way. It’s due not just to her own maneuvering, but to a variety of circumstances: a chaotic […]

No one knows. His views are so flexible one is led to believe the Republican Minority Leader was previously part of a gymnastics team. On Trump’s Deadly Mob: One day, he claims Trump “bears responsibility” for inspiring the insurrection that resulted in five American deaths. Another day, McCarthy says Trump “didn’t provoke” the deadly mob he instructed […]

Americans are hurting. Millions have lost their jobs and more than 450,000 have died in the U.S. from COVID-19. The days of going on “pause” are over. This is why Democrats, led by President Biden, are taking bold action which is widely supported by people across the country: 68% support the Biden-Harris Administration’s American Rescue […]

Women should take strength from their lived experience, both positive and negative, as they make plans for their future. That’s the message Nancy Pelosi delivered to youth poet laureate Amanda Gorman during a virtual Q&A Monday in honor of International Women’s Day, Deadline reported.

In a conversation moderated by Amanda Gorman, the current House speaker and former secretary of state also talked about how to bring more women into politics and navigating male-dominated work environments: “We have to have each other’s backs.”
