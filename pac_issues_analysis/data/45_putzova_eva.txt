Sorry, the page you are trying to access is not accepting submissions at this time.

Our representatives should answer to the people, not their corporate donors.

For too long, working people have been put second to the priorities of corporations.

Along with other newly elected members of Congress, I support a "Green New Deal" that would set an ambitious but necessary goal to help stabilize the climate and therefore our global society.

Our campaign is 100% powered by people. We don’t accept any money from corporate PACs or special interests. Politicians should work for the people they represent, not the private interests that bankroll their campaigns.

In consultation with Indigenous leaders, I will fight for adequate federal support the tribes need to provide a decent life for all their members and true sovereignty.

The costs of higher education should not become a burden to young people that they carry with them for the rest of their lives.

Health care is a right, not a privilege. I support universal, affordable, quality healthcare.

I‘m determined to bring a perspective of fairness, inclusion, justice, peace, and democracy into Congress.

I oppose all undeclared, illegal wars of choice and will work hard to ensure that Congress asserts its constitutional oversight responsibility over the executive branch on matters of war and peace.

People have the right to control their own bodies free of government interference.

In addition to earning her master’s degree from the University of Economics in Bratislava, Slovakia, Eva completed leadership programs at Harvard University and Cornell University. In 2015, she received an Arizona Woman of Vision Award from the Arizona Women’s Conference and in 2017, the Eleanor Roosevelt Award given annually by the Coconino County Democratic Party for demonstrating democratic values in her service to the community.

Sorry, the page you are trying to access is not accepting submissions at this time.

During her 14-year tenure at Northern Arizona University she held a number of positions, including Director of Strategic Planning and Executive Director for Marketing and Strategic Communications. Until recently, she was a National Communications and Technology Director for Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, working to raise wages and improve working conditions for the country’s 13 million restaurant workers.

Eva Putzova (/ˈe/ /vä/ /ˈpüt/ /zō/ /ˈvä/) was born and raised in Slovakia and made Flagstaff, Arizona her home in 2000. She started her professional career in the renewable energy sector and, in 2003, began working in higher education.

Check all options you’re interested in and we’ll provide details for each once we know you’re in.

Eva is running to represent working people in Congress, not corporations.

As a policymaker she consistently put people first, and she intends to bring that perspective into Congress. While valuing fairness, inclusion, justice, peace, and democracy, she will champion universal healthcare, tuition-free college, immigration overhaul, and meaningful climate action through proposals like the Green New Deal and Indigenous rights, women’s reproductive rights, and workers’ rights. She will also raise a strong voice against the never-ending wars that cost thousands of lives, bankrupt our economy and make us less safe.
