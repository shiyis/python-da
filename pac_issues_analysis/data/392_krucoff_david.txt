Finally win complete DC voting rights, including Senators, but without increasing the size of the Senate, which we should acknowledge, is a non-starter politically. We do this by creating Douglass County, Maryland; DC for short.

'Jefferson' Krucoff Pushes The Color Purple on DC's Corrupt Elite

It was great to be featured in this recent piece in Issues & Insights. Although the piece is harsh and grating, it accurately highlights the need for new and novel thinking and action inside the halls of Congress and in the John Wilson Building. I am proud to represent the exhausted and frustrated "center" inside the DC beltway and promise to stand up to the extremes as a member of Congress. Our DC Delegate should not represent hyper-partisan interests, but rather stand as a symbol of non-partisan leadership for a great American revival.

Hi, I'm David

 <tag> h5


My disappointment with the results of DC’s efforts to gain full representation boiled over when I attended a disingenuous Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee hearing on DC enfranchisement in September of 2015. At the hearing, Senator Carper, the only Senator on the committee that was present, begged all the witnesses from DC if there was anything that could be done other than for DC to become the fifty-first state. One after the other, our representatives answered that there was nothing else that could be done. However, all of them knew about the Virginia Retrocession in 1846-47, when the Virginia portion of the District of Columbia was returned to the state from where it was ceded. They avoided the question or lied in their responses right in front of hundreds of us that day. At that moment, I decided to become an activist to help change the debate and elevate the discourse.
