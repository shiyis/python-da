Keep Us Safe

 <tag> p




Californians pay some of the highest taxes in the nation and our government wastes much of that money. Jay will fight taxes and hold government accountable.

California Small Business Association

He’s a business owner who has created hundreds of good, high-paying jobs, a pilot who volunteers with the Veterans Airlift Command, and an accomplished state lawmaker. From standing up for taxpayers, to cutting bureaucratic red tape, to improving the quality of life for our veterans, and passing legislation to crack down on criminals and keep our families safe, Jay is ready to fight for us.

Jay has been a job creator for over 3 decades. He will use his experience to grow our economy and bring jobs to our community.

Address: 18368 Cocopah Road, Apple Valley, CA 92307

Jay Obernolte isn’t a career politician.

Jay has consistently fought for our veterans and that won’t change when he is in Congress.

Jay has fought against government encroachment into our privacy and our personal liberties. In Congress he will fight for our liberties.

As a state Assemblyman Jay figured out how to cut through the partisanship and pass legislation that helps California’s hardworking families. He’ll do the same for us in Washington.
