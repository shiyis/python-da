The family and the school need to be a team. The family must be taken into consideration regarding funding. Science fairs, field trips, supplies, weather appropriate clothing, even gas to get children to school are all funding issues that must not be taken for granted. Your tax money must be used to provide for the complete picture. As your Congressman I will work to see that all students' needs and rights are met. 2. We need an immediate answer to deal with the new realities of life-threatening violence at schools. As your congressman I will work with anyone and everyone I can to get armed security officers in all public Schools. Students faculty and staff need a responder in 15 seconds, not 15 minutes.

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.

1. Our schools leave much to be desired. Teachers having to buy supplies from their personal funds is unacceptable! Our facilities should be examples of prosperity not broken down disgraces! The government overtaxes us and fails to provide for the vital investment in our childrens' futures. As your Congressman I will ever work to -reduce federal waste -redirect federal funds -find State, County and Civic fellow workers to find answers, so that your money can be redirected to bring funding to: -Repair, replace, expand, improve school facilities -Provide ample classroom supplies -Provide a sufficient number of modern quality school buses

--Dale K. Mensing

An American Odyssey Amid the struggles of mankind there came a task, and freedom shined on those on whom chains were consigned. How came the leader the way to find? What made him the Emancipator? What brought him to that door? 'Twas the pathway that he trod from the cabin to the sod. Of melancholy journey born, whom of glory found and lost knew the battle and the cost. What made him the Emancipator-- mid-west small town railsplitter? What brought him to that door? 'Twas the pathway that he trod from the cabin to the sod. Springfield bound there was a train-- the course of sorrow rolling. In a car his casket has lain as mournful din (the bell) was tolling! And, this which Providence doth send: 'tis a wound time shall not mend. What brought him then to such an end? 'Twas the pathway that he trod from the cabin to the sod.

-Dale K. Mensing

The Quest Atlanta born there was a man who in his youth had known the wrongs of racial hate-- and thus began the quest where living love belongs. Of brotherhood he dared to dream: so, peaceful action was the way. Amid sin's torrent truth would stream: by words and courage, hearts he'd sway. With Truth in triumph, Glory bound: our brother gone, our Freedom found. A shadow then was o'er our land as an entitlement unpaid. There came a time to take a stand: true justice must not be delayed. This man knew well what was at stake: the righteous "whirlwinds of revolt" would make our land's foundations shake, as Selma was a thunderbolt. With Truth in triumph, Glory bound: our brother gone, our Freedom found. There is a spirit of decay which vies within the human heart. In early April came a day when that wrong spirit did impart an act for which all words do fail. That early April brought a deed which for all time did lift the veil of where a valiant life may lead. With Truth in triumph, Glory bound: our brother gone, our Freedom found.

Fundamental Transformation

 <tag> p




* * * * * *

There is a law. The law is hard to read. The law is far too complicated for any mortal to fully grasp. The law has 20,000 pages and never stops growing. The law encompasses one sixth of the United States economy. The law violates religious conscience. The law violates moral conscience. The law violates the basic American premise of self-determination. The law is pervasive to the extent that it delves into the most private and personal elements of people's lives. The law, called the Affordable Care Act, objectifies the American people. Its purpose is to provide a foundation for the fundamental transformation of the United States.

“Let her and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter?” Milton, Areopagitca-1644

INDEX

My name is Dale K. Mensing. I am a working man. I am running for Congress for the purpose of defending the integrity of the Bill of Rights. The past twenty years or so have brought to my ears the repeated exclamation that, “We just have to accept the fact that the Bill of Rightsjust isn't real for us anymore.” Well, the Bill of Rights is very real for me. I will defend that reality by exposing attacks on freedom. All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for enough good people to do nothing. The purpose of the 20,000 page Affordable Care Act is for it to serve as a foundation for the fundamental transformation of the United States. The ACA is a foundation for transformation because it is a setting for attacking the freedom of religion, the right to privacy, and the right not to be objectified by the government. Freedom of religion is being attacked because millions of citizens embrace a spiritual sanctification which requires separation from any system that even appears to endorse contraception and or abortion. The right to privacy is being attacked because, within the ACA, there is a non-HIPAA compliant statement in a “hidden source code” which states, “You have no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication of any data transmitted or stored in this information system.” Let me assure you that every diminishing of your privacy is a diminishing of your freedom. We are being objectified as our right to the freedom of self-determination is being systematically challenged. We are being told to sign up and purchase a product that is designed for the purpose of our subjugation. Article I, Section 8 of the constitution makes it clear that laws should be “necessary and proper." Attacking freedom under the guise of providing help is anything but necessary and proper. It has been said, “Control health care and you control the people.” As your Congressman, I will work to achieve a constitutional answer to our health care troubles. To begin with, we need to put the patient first. This means that the ACA needs to be revoked. We must be aware that a primary author of the ACA, Robert Creamer, is a radical communist criminal who espouses systems of deceit to gain public acceptance of the law. Deceiving the public is the opposite of putting the patient first. Voting to approve a law without reading it is not a way of putting the patient first, either. And, putting the patient first means putting the whole patient first, including their religious faith. Of course, we need to guarantee entitlements already provided in MediCare. We should consider providing different approaches for different types of people: Something akin to a health savings account for those who could best benefit from that approach. We need plans that encourage rather than discourage doctors to serve in rural and remote communities. Also, finding a way to evolve away from absolute Federal oversight of health care would certainly be in the best interest of the patient. The people of Northern California certainly know what to do for the people of northern California far better than Washington D.C. Knows what to do for the people of Northern California. I know that exemplary health care and truth must co-reside . I respectfully encourage the reader to attend a fund raising rally at the Garberville Vets Hall on Friday, July 18th at 7:00 PM. Dale K. Mensing

*************************************************************************************************************

Everything about the law is falsehood. The Tenth Amendment was intended to prevent repeating the likes of King George III. The Tenth Amendment was intended to prevent the likes of the Affordable Care Act. In order to justify their usurping of the Tenth Amendment, the leaders of the Progressives have resorted to the Commerce Clause, which is found in the third paragraph of section 8 of the first article of the Constitution, and indicates that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce among the several states. The method of regulating commerce is found in paragraph 18, and provides that Congress may make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution such regulation of commerce. I feel very strongly that regulating commerce does not mean usurping and dominating commerce. And, I feel that, "necessary and proper" are just the opposite of the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act is a culmination of ideas which together assert the concept that the government knows best, does best and has the right to lie, cheat and connive because the end justifies the means. In order to understand this outlook, may I suggest that you consult President Obama's playbook. The book, acknowledging Lucifer, is called, RULES FOR RADICALS, and was written by Saul Alinsky. The antidote to the Affordable Care Act is an evolution. In deference to the Bill of Rights, federal oversight and taxing for health care must completely give way to State and local oversight. I call this evolution, "Medistate." By way of Medistate, the States, local governments and private organizations would then have the money to doctor and nurse if they were not being robbed by the absurdly expensive bureaucracy of the federal system.

The Four Elements

 <tag> p




* * * * * *

The Four Elements

“Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties.”― John Milton, Areopagitica

Candidate for Member of the State Assembly; District 6 This information is provided by the candidate Read about Jared Huffman's agenda for protecting California's environment, and see why he's won every environmental group endorsement in the race, including Seirra Club......

*************************************************************************************************************

.....3. Fighting the Republican Assault on our Environment Our most important environmental laws are under blistering attack from President Bush and his allies. Cowboy Congressman Richard Pombo is leading an effort to gut the Endangered Species Act by giving developers and commercial interests priority over endangered wildlife. The Supreme Court is poised to re-interpret the Clean Water Act to remove protections for millions of acres of wetlands and countless tributary streams. And using the pretext of our infrastructure needs, Republicans in Sacramento are seeking broad new exemptions from environmental laws. California's environmental laws are our last line of defense and must be strengthened, not weakened. That includes bolstering California's Endangered Species Act to replace lost federal protections; promoting better planning before species are pushed to the brink; and ensuring the Porter-Cologne Act--which protected us before passage of the federal Clean Water Act in 1972--is broadly applied to all California wetlands and streams. Marin and Sonoma residents understand that these laws protect our natural heritage, our quality of life, and our children's health.

The process surrounding the construction of the Willits Bypass demonstrates a collection of symptoms that indicate a malevolent force within our State government leadership. What are the elements of the process? The first element of the wrongness of the bypass is the clear fact that the bypass is unnecessary. Those who planned the bypass have disregarded the obvious fact that the level of traffic flow does not warrant a bypass. The bypass is not necessary because a large percentage of the vehicles going in and out of Willits on Hwy 101 North or South will bypass the bypass because they are going to and from Hwy 20 and Brooktrails. Michael Fitzgerral, Tribal Chairman of the Sherwood Valley Rancheria, told me that according to his studies, only 30 percent of traffic would be diverted by a bypass. The real issue is not the necessity of bypassing Willits, but instead, the real issue is that of reducing the congestion of traffic that must come in and out of Willits for various reasons -- including just passing through and perhaps stopping to shop. The real solution would have been to have built three lanes running north on the route of the railroad corridor which passes through town just 3 blocks east of present Hwy 101, and to have built three lanes running south on present 101. The city of Eureka has three lanes which run east as 5th Street and three lanes which run west as 4th Street. Willits would have then continued to enjoy the financial benefits of the flow of traffic, just like that which Eureka enjoys and will enjoy forever on the very same Highway 101. Caltrans says that various regulations and laws prevented the use of the railroad corridor. The railway is “considered an active railway.” Railroad employees tell me that it has not been used for twelve years. It is obviously not an active railway, but being presented as such, made the use of the corridor supposedly untenable in Caltrans' eyes. If ever there were a case for exercising the concept of eminent domain then this is it. Besides, haven't the railroads already received far more than their due of government compensation and leeway? The cost of this plan would be microscopic compared to the cost of the bypass. So, the first element of the process is the disregard of logic. No real consideration of the railroad corridor was ever made . Of course, there would have been some kind of a legal battle no matter which route were proposed. As the first element of the wrongness of the bypass is the disregard of the clear fact that the bypass is unnecessary for reducing congestion, the second element of the wrongness of the bypass is the fact that it involves the shocking destruction of precious wetlands, precious animal habitats and scores of mature trees. Much of this destruction involves the repeated breaching of the wetlands substrate by the planting of mammoth stanchions which support the long causeway segment of the bypass. Thank you for this, your assessment, Will Parrish: “this horrible, unnecessary, wasteful, environmentally destructive boondoggle.” Dictionary.com, Boondoggle: noun. a project funded by the federal government out of political favoritism that is of no real value to the community or the nation. If you are going to build an unnecessary freeway that will destroy wetlands, and do this with the alleged idea of replacing the wetlands, you could make a hint at honor by creating the new wetlands first, then build the unnecessary freeway and destroy the original wetlands after you have shown yourself to be a trustworthy and competent wetlands re-builder. That way the birds and other animals won't be left in the lurch during the years in between, while you eventually get around to being able to keep your word. Jared Huffman seems to have helped to facilitate this debacle through his communications with the Army Corps of Engineers. He seems to have played a part in convincing the Corps of Engineers to allow Caltrans to continue to build the unnecessary freeway with the idea that Caltrans will get around to creating new wetlands some time in the future. "CalTrans will then begin "'wetland establishment work this year'" of about three to five acres, unless it discovers unforeseen archaeological sites."-- Mendocino Beacon, July 10, 2014. Jared Huffman presents himself as an "environmental leader." The third element of the wrongness of the bypass is the fact that there are various Pomo archaeological sites within the area designated for the supposed new wetlands. I met with Lee Clauss, the highly respected archaeologist who has examined Little Lake Valley at the behest of the Sherwood Valley Pomo. She made it very clear to me that there are significant Pomo archaeological sites along the entire circumference of Little Lake Valley. It is now clear that Caltrans can do no good. Of course, Caltrans' leaders know it was wrong to build the unnecessary freeway. So, of course, they would not honorably seek out the possibility of the presence of archaeological sites where they dishonorably destroy irreplaceable wetlands. Fourthly, even though Caltrans is building a two lane bypass, they have made it clear that they plan to build an exiting roundabout to accommodate a future four lane bypass. The idea of eventually needing to make the bypass a four lane freeway is an absurdity because everyone knows that Hwy 101 will always be a two lane highway along the five miles just north of town. The largeness of this roundabout will also destroy an archaeological site. Priscilla Hunter of the Coyote Band of the Pomo told me that Caltrans has to acknowledge archeological sites, but “acknowledgment” is about all that they must legally do. Without an injunction they can legally go ahead and build their giant roundabout right over the archaeological site. Boondoggle? Yes. When I met with Michael Fitzgerral, he made it clear to me that he wished that Caltrans would have shown justification for their plans. And, he felt that they should have executed good faith in regard to their responsibilities to take into proper consideration all of the complex elements involved in fish migration, stream degradation, bird migration and traffic flow to Brooktrails and Highway 20. He also feels that they should have given careful regard to the possibility of the presence of archaeological sites. The problems are deep. Once a bureaucracy gets going with an idea, the inertia never stops.. They never stop trying because, as a government bureaucracy they must survive by ever expanding. Of course, the real issues are money and power. As they expand,there is more money. Those who facilitate the expanding, do then augment their power. We must not acquiesce. As a free people, we have the right to expect complete openness and honesty from the spenders of our tax dollars. Since there is no real logical call for a bypass, the fact that it is being done anyway, at the expense of our area's precious wetlands and native Pomo archaeological sites, calls for the question, “what are the real forces behind the bypass?” I expect that a sin of this magnitude is the result of various interplays of vanity. There is the leadership of Caltrans, and there is the leadership of the Army Corps of Engineers who ultimately receive their orders from various Commanders in Chief, who receive their playbooks from a breed of aloof financiers. “What rarely gets mentioned is that the Willits bypass is part an ongoing series of Caltrans projects designed to open up the California North Coast to large trucks, thereby creating a through loop to foment the development of Humboldt and Del Norte counties (where these trucks are currently banned). The best we can hope for is an informed citizenry willing to stand in the way of bulldozers poised to do irreversible damage to a pristine valley once the deal-makers have provided the project with legal cover.”--GREG KING President, Siskiyou Land Conservancy. "This is also what the ‘Smart train’ coming now up to Cloverdale and eventually further North is also about. The rails are being laid to accommodate commercial traffic. It is part of a grand UN Agenda 21 overall ‘Smart Growth’ agenda being directed internationally into every region to control all resources and people." --James Lee, Anderson Valley http://www.democratsagainstunagenda21.com A critical read is Rosa Kloire’s excellent expose of what is going on right here in the North Bay and beyond titled, “Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21″ --James Lee, Anderson Valley http://www.amazon.com/BEHIND-THE-GREEN-MASK As your Congressman I will work to eliminate any possible funding for the completion of this monstrosity. As a citizen, I will continually protest the completion of the bypass and the four lane accommodating roundabout.

I respectfully suggest that the reader consider the implications of the contrast between Jared Huffman's part in destroying wetlands to facilitate infrastructure needs in 2014, and his statement rebuking the removing of wetlands protection, "using the pretext of our infrastructure needs" in 2006. --Dale K. Mensing

I respectfully suggest that the reader consider the implications of the contrast between Jared Huffman's part in destroying wetlands to facilitate infrastructure needs in 2014, and his statement rebuking the removing of wetlands protection, "using the pretext of our infrastructure needs" in 2006. --Dale K.

The Utah Data Center is a Federal government installation which seeks to possess all information about everyone.

The right to privacy includes the right to have freedom of thought. True freedom of thought includes the right to be innocently free to be afraid of anything you want, for any reason that you want -- without anyone else knowing about it. The right to be innocently afraid is part of being an American, possessing the right to the freedom of self -determination. Hence, the right to privacy.

The Right to Privacy

It reads, "IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR."

What has been done is that on October 26, 2001, the so called, “Patriot Act” was enacted to allow for the creation of national security letters. A national security letter, or, NSL, is a subpoena to gather information for “national security” purposes. An NSL does not require prior approval from a judge. The Patriot Act augmented the Stored Communications Act, The Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Right to Financial Privacy Act to authorize the FBI to investigate without a warrant. The FBI can request only “non-content information.” The FBI cannot demand the “content information” of telephone calls and e-mails, but they can demand phone numbers dialed and transactional records. What we must do is ask ourselves what we think about the fact that these things can be done without a warrant. The Fourth Amendment requires that a warrant be issued for a search and seizure. Warrants come from judges. We vote for judges. We vote for the people who appoint judges. The FBI operates under the auspices of the Attorney General who operates under the auspices of the President. Do you trust Presidents? Which Presidents do you trust? I understand the FBI's need to learn about the actions of terrorists. But, I have a much, much deeper understanding of the need to require of the FBI a search warrant for the violation of anyone's privacy. The Patriot Act has established the following precedent: now, or in the near or distant future, your privacy can be completely abolished because, now, this Fourth Amendment violating stepping stone to captivity and objectification has been laid. The clincher to this is the fact that, although the Patriot Act has been revised by the USA Freedom Act, there is no provision for the eventual destruction of any information obtained. Also, please note that all alleged pertinent elements of the USA Freedom Act are sidestepped by the continuing secrecy allowed by the 2008 FISA Amendments Act. Information about anyone, can, and probably will be secretly obtained and retained and stored at the super computer storage facility at the Intelligence Community Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative Data Center, in Bluffdale, Utah. The sign at the entrance to the Bluffdale, Utah Data Center reads, “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.” I encourage the reader to think very deeply about the ramifications of such a statement. As your Congressman, I will continue to pursue the elimination of searches without warrants.

“Let her and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter?”--Milton, Areopagitica

The Fourth Amendment states, “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” The key to the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment lies in the chosen understanding of the word, ”unreasonable.” Reason dictates that it is not unreasonable that more searches and seizures will occur during times of war than at times of peace. And, as, through the use of traitors and infiltrators, ISIS has declared war on our country and on our sworn allies, the question arises, “How do we discover our enemies without establishing an inescapable privacy breaching precedent?” The enemy will hide their plans, their weapons, and themselves. What can we do? What must we not do? What has been done?

Forest Regionalism--The Root of the Change

Forest Regionalism--The Root of the Change

As a society we need wood. I know that logging can be done in a responsible non-expoitive manner. Caring for steams, replanting and selective logging can be implemented to provide timber and timber jobs in a way that works in concert with the needs of the forest and forest communities. Marijuana should be legalized and taxed as a controlled substance. Funds acquired through this taxation should be used to eradicate illegal grows in State and national forests. "Medical Marijuana" should not be taxed. As your congressman, I will seek out all interested parties to find an answer to the host of problems created by illegal grows. The list of problems includes litter, toxic dumping, rodenticides, violence, stream damage, water diversion, water theft and trespassing. My decisions are based on my personal sense of honor. I have no debts to industries, organizations or lobby groups. My interest in the forests involves my willingness to learn and to work. I would appreciate your vote.

Because the east bay area has so many people, they cajole themselves into feeling that it is okay to take advantage of the less populated north country. They think it is logical to take the North Country's water to solve their problems-- even if it creates problems in the north. Not the least of these problems is the effect on the north's tourist industry. Here is an idea: if the east bay area needs more water, why don't they start desalinization projects like San Diego and Arabia? Or, try covering the canals with solar panels to reduce evaporation like they do in India. The electricity from these panels could be used to power desalinization. They could construct a variety of types and systems of water storage. Basically, they should find ways to solve their problems with investment and innovation rather than just taking the north's water. The Central Valley Water Project, which takes Trinity County water, was established in 1933 for the purpose of providing water for agriculture. It will now use Trinity water to augment the delta ecosystem rather than for valley agriculture. It just so happens that the North Country has an ecosystem too. As your congressman, I will work to defend the north's water. The Forest Service has changed. The root of the change is philosophical. In response to a variety of forces such as economics, culture, and Agenda 21, the Forest Service has come to regard the forest as an ecosystem to be maintained through their ideas of protection. This philosophy includes the idea that underbrush should be left to the whims of nature, including potential fire. However, when fire occurs, we must fight the whims of nature. Their philosophy is exercised at the expense of "multiple use" needs. I strongly embrace the idea of having and protecting primitive areas like the Trinity Alps, the Yolla Bolly Wilderness and the Marble Mountains. But, we also have a new wilderness. People live in and around national forests and their use of the land needs to reflect the fact that the forest can be used but not exploited. One of the primary problems that the north country faces is forest fires. It is clear that forest fire size, intensity, amount of smoke and financial cost are all very much exacerbated by the fact that underbrush is not cleared. Good logging companies used to do this work as part of their responsibilities in harvesting. These forest fires obviously create much destruction and smoke. Many of our leaders regularly express concern about the need to take various actions to curb air pollution. I find forest fire smoke to be on a par with auto and industrial exhaust. Smoke is bad for the health and comfort of our citizens. And, smoke and charred forests certainly discourage tourism. We can not go back in time. The new wilderness of today needs to be cared for in such a way that all valid interests are taken into consideration. Citizens who wish to work can be employed to clear underbrush and reverse riparian damage. They can be paid to do this using funds that are currently allocated for food stamps or other government programs. The California Conservation Corps could be expanded to provide such employment. There is much, much less financial cost in preventing fire than there is in fighting fire.

Forest Regionalism--The Root of the Change


=====LINK SOURCE: https://www.theflamingarrow.com/processes-in-california-education.html=====

 <tag> p


I have become deeply aware of the fact that my country has a cause. My country's cause is the fulfilling of the continuing role of being the world's example of what must be achieved in the centuries long, holy quest for Freedom. American Freedom is actualized in equality and self-determination. I ever seek to be part of my country's cause. The fact that there is a vital, continuing struggle in the quest for the complete realization of equality and self-determination demonstrates the true existence of Freedom's unholy rivals: the loathed spirits of captivity and objectification. The method used to create the dual malefaction of captivity and objectification is a governmentally induced dependence – wherein individuals are trained to ask, “What can the government do for me?” rather than, “What can I do for my country?” America's Freedom comes from education and courage. We are free because we know what we need to do and we have the courage to do it. We will continue to be free as long as we have the courage to be educated about Freedom. There is a high refinement about what we are as a free people-- a refinement which once adulterated by ignorance and its consequences, may never again be attained. So, the vital element to this refinement is the understanding that being educated about Freedom can never be taken for granted. Hence, the following: The enemies of Freedom know that “miseducation” [To educate improperly (American Heritage Dictionary), a wrong or deficient education ( Collins English Dictionary)] is the key to Freedom's abolition. Advanced are three primary processes for miseducation.

************************************************************************************************************



The first primary process for miseducation is the attempts to greatly reduce the power of the State. The power of the State is a key element of the American system that brought about Freedom in the first place. True Freedom of thought persists because of absence of centralization. Each of the colonies had a different approach to life, and therefor there were at least thirteen different approaches to education. Being part of the British Empire demonstrated to the colonists that a distant central authority breeds captivity, objectification, and dependence. Of course, some centralization is necessary to the Union. Yet, education by experience revealed to the colonists, the patriots and the framers that too much centralization is very bad for Freedom. Much of the answer to the potential problems of over-centralization is found in the Tenth Amendment: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." As the idea of education is not found in the Constitution, education is reserved to the States or the people. Of course, for several arenas elemental to everyday life, such as education, the Tenth Amendment is a vital hallmark of Freedom. So, the Liberal hates the Tenth Amendment. The attempt to eliminate the power of the States and the power of people is called Statism. Defining the term, “Statist”, Dictionary.com says, “the principle or policy of concentrating extensive economic, political, and related controls in the state (“state” meaning: federal or national government) at the cost of individual liberty.” In order to eliminate the power of the States or the people, the federal government overtaxes the individual. This overtaxing removes potential resources for education from families, school districts, counties, and States. In order to retrieve some of the tax money, these debilitated groups, then, generally allow themselves to be bribed by the federal government. The money comes back with very serious strings attached. Prominent among the strings attached to federal education money is the insistence that communist ideas must be taught and applied. Such ideas include assertions or implications that it is wrong for a law abiding citizen to own a gun, the idea that freedom of religion means freedom from religion, the idea that the federal government has the final word on curriculum and teaching strategies, and the idea that the main purpose of education is to prepare a person to be a productive functionary in a global economy. Among many other things, the Statist way of thinking brought about Ronald Reagan's signing of the U.S.-USSR Education Exchange Agreement in Geneva in 1985. The Statist way of thinking also brought about Senate Bill S.1177, the Every Student Succeeds Act, Which became Public Law No: 114-95 on 12/10/2015. Both of these federal actions provide templates for communist indoctrination of the students in the public schools of the United States.

INDEX

The second primary process for miseducation is the implementation of the purpose and philosophy of UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. To understand the United Nations is to understand that it is built all about the United States. It was founded in San Francisco. It is headquartered in New York City. It is the offspring of the League of Nations, which was the brain child of the “Jekyll Island” American President, Woodrow Wilson. Although there are 193 countries in the UN, 22% of the financing comes from the United States, 5% comes from Communist China, and 2.5% comes from Russia. Because of our Freedom and what we have done with it, the United States is unique in its greatness. Our greatness makes us the primary target of Communism. The United Nations is used as a platform from which to attack us-- seeking to destroy us for what we are. One of the principal goals of the UN is to limit national sovereignty-- especially that of the United States. Our principles of equality and self-determination can continue if we firmly hold on to our independence. Yet, the more that we subject elements of our society to the auspices of a global organization that ever seeks to limit and eventually abolish all nation's national sovereignty, then the less Freedom we will have. I respectfully suggest to the reader that they take into consideration the origins of the United Nations and the philosophies of its most significant founders, Alger Hiss (founding member of the Ware Group, a covert organization of Communist Party USA) and the Woodrow Wilson protege John Foster Dulles-- both of whom were promulgators of "Internationalism," or the “One World Order.” Be assured that 1950's "Internationalism" or our current “One World Order” or “New World Order” mean, “Communist United States.” UNESCO's communist onslaught is found in California's classrooms under the name, “Common Core.” On November 17, 2004, UNESCO signed a “Cooperation Agreement” with Microsoft to develop a “master curriculum” which has become the foundation of Common Core. According to Dennis L. Cuddy Ph.d., “Gates initialed every page and agreed that this curriculum was to reflect UNESCO's values. These values were explained in first UNESCO Director-General Julian Huxley's UNESCO: ITS PURPOSE AND ITS PHILOSOPHY as including “a scientific world humanism, global in extent and evolutionary in background”—May,11,2015 NewsWithViews.com. Such “a scientific world humanism” has found its grand standard bearer in John Dewey, who's influence has done much to establish a receptive audience for Marxism in the youth of America. Common Core curriculum is Statist. The monitoring of the students is overtly Orwellian. The federal purpose of Common Core is to arrange students to be able to participate in an arranged global production system (outcomes/performance based education), reflecting the 1985 Geneva Summit's U.S.-USSR Education Exchange Agreement. Common Core standards and tactics are an effort to eliminate the American spirit of courageous individuality, free thinking and vibrant self-determination. Rather than being debased by the influence of UNESCO, our schools need to teach with the purpose of helping students understand and achieve their inherent roll in the working out of Liberty. The third primary process for miseducation is the liberal and the neoconservative applications of the principles of Trotsky's, "Fourth International." The objective of The Fourth International is to eventuate socialism in various countries, especially the United States, with the ultimate goal of world communism. Leon Trotsky wrote, “Despite all the defeats of the proletariat, the position of the class enemy remains a hopeless one. Capitalism is doomed. Only in the socialist revolution is there salvation for mankind.” -- Open Letter for The Fourth International, First Published: New Militant [New York], August 3, 1935. Translated: New Militant. The founding of the neoconservative movement involved the embracing of the communist philosophies of Leon Trotsky. Irving Kristol, regarded as the “godfather of neoconservatism” was a Trotskyite in 1940 and became an avid proponent of Statist, Centralized Government. Basic Trotskyite financing and basic neoconsevative financing come from related elitist globalists. An example of this globalist financing is the use of Elihu Root, the founding chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, to facilitate the financing of Trotsky's Bolsheviks. Another demonstration of globalist financing of socialism comes from Anthony Sutton. In his, Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, Sutton wrote of top tier financier Andrew Carnegie's financing of the “Marburg Plan.” This was a plan in which the world's governments would become communist, while the ultimate power would actually be in the hands of the Wall Street types “to control its councils and enforce peace [and so] provide a specific for all the political ills of mankind.” In his, History of the Jews in the Soviet Union, Alexander Isayavivh Solzhenitsyn points to the “amoral logic of this long and consistent relationship” between Wall Street and socialism. Carnegie's involvement in the “Marburg Plan” was only a part of his seminal and singularly wide efforts toward miseducating the American youth toward a scientific world humanism (Communism). The fact that the arch-globalist Bechtel Corporation financed Ronald Reagan's winning bid for the Presidency, demonstrates President Reagan's actual neoconservative colors. His neoconservative affiliations explain his being an accomplice to the aforementioned 1985 U.S.-USSR Education Exchange Agreement, which has helped to quietly circumvent the west's supposed victory in the “Cold War.” Globalist George Pratt Schultz negotiated the U.S.-USSR Education Exchange Agreement. Please note that George Pratt Schultz (Secretary of State), Caspar Weinberger (Secretary of Defense), William Casey (Director of the Central Intelligence Agency) , and Kenneth Davis (Deputy Secretary of Energy) were all with Bechtel before they became part of the Reagan administration. Truly, the most influential individuals within Congress support the neoconservative ideas of centralized, elitist, anti-constitutional government that fosters a reinforcement of all things “New World Order.” This includes going along with NAFTA, the Patriot Act, the two Invasions of Iraq (the first invasion of Iraq was a United Nations Police Action), and strongly supporting communist Common Core education. The multiple facets of Agenda 21, such as “Smart Growth”, government-private partnerships such as ICLEI (International Council on Local Environmental Initiatives) and William Clinton's, “President's Council on Sustainable Development” are all globalist concepts supported and perpetuated by neoconservatives. These concepts are also integral to the goals of the neoconservative's Liberal, counterparts: the leaders of the Democratic Party. Regarding the Democratic party, I respectfully suggest to the reader that they study the relationship between Franklin D. Roosevelt's Vice-President, Henry Wallace, and the communist cell of Harrold Ware. When the neoconservative president George W. Bush chose to promote the Statist, “No Child Left Behind” education debacle, he appointed the liberal Senator Ted Kennedy to work out the details. It was liberal President Barack Obama who pushed the States to administer Common Core miseducation. The attempts to greatly reduce the power of the States, the implementing of the purpose and philosophy of UNESCO, and the applying of the principles of Trotsky's Fourth International are three processes embraced by essentially the same people. If they like one of these processes, then they like the other two. They are a breed that seeks to objectify everyone but their own ruling class. Statists, UNESCO, the neoconservatives and the Liberal Democratic leaders understand that the essential first step toward implementing communism is the miseducation of youth. By way of their scheming, federalized education is the weed from which slavery is to be propagated. We must show courage! Liberty requires the kind of education that only courage can bring. As your Congressman, I will ever seek to eliminate Common Core and the Department of Education. I will continue to advocate the United States' withdrawal from the United Nations. I will continue to work toward a federal flat income tax that will make education funds available to home schooling, private schooling and local school districts.

Should you and I ask questions about chemtrails? In 2014, one of my campaign supporters asked me what I thought about geoengineering. I told my campaign supporter that I knew nothing about it, but that I would look into it. What I learned is a variety of things that I feel everyone should be thinking about. The first thing that I found to be very compelling was a Shasta County, California Board of Supervisors meeting that was held on July 15, 2014. I found it quite notable that it was the most well attended Supervisors meeting in the history of Shasta County. That attendance record caused me to take special note of what was being said. Scientists took the podium and explained their understanding of the shockingly caustic effects on the environment of what are termed, "chemtrails." I have learned that chemtrails are a method of geoengineering -- they involve the spraying into the atmosphere a variety of caustic chemicals. These caustic chemicals form cloud-like trails from jets, and I frequently and regularly see them in the skies above Humboldt county. I respectfully suggest to the reader that they access the audio-video record of the Shasta County meeting in which Dane Wigington spoke at length about various element of chemtrails. Below is a link to this video. Also, Dane Wigington has a website that contains a great deal of information on the subject. My friends Bud Rogers and Krystina Schindler broadcasted a weekly radio show for a full year on KMUD radio on which they interviewed many people and provided much information. I have many questions and I know a few things. I know enough tell the reader that dealing with chemtrails is one of the three primary issues of my campaign for the house of representatives. As I post these paragraphs, I plan to add more in the days and weeks to come.

The Federal Reserve is a cartel. People often ask me questions about various economic issues -- and what I would do to resolve them. My usual answer is that these various economic problems are really just symptoms of a disease. Rather than place our attention on masking or temporarily forestalling a symptom, we should eliminate the disease. The disease is the fact that Federal Reserve, a private organization, sets our economy's interest rates, implements fractional reserve lending and monetizes debt. All three of these processes are directed by an organization in Basil Switzerland called, The Bank of International Settlements. The current system of rules that come from The Bank of International Settlements is called, "Basil 3." I feel that our economy should be much more laissez faire, and certainly not directed by the Swiss hub of globalism.

By Dennis L. Cuddy, Ph.D. March 16, 2015 NewsWithViews.com In HORACE MANN : EDUCAT0NAL STATESMAN, E.I.F. Williams related that Robert Owen "brought William McClure, 'father of American geology,' to organize his school. He first introduced the Pestalozzian system into the United States....Later, the Pestalozzian movement spread to other sections (of the country), and among its enthusiastic champions were Horace Mann....Very soon (after New Harmony) another society based on Owen's principles was begun at Yellow Springs, Ohio, where Antioch College was to be founded." Horace Mann was president of Antioch College from 1853 until his death on August 2, 1859. In 1837, Mann had established the first "normal" (public) school in the United States as part of his effort to promote non-sectarian education. In 1848, the COMMUNIST MANIFESTO was published, including Plank No. 10, which provided for a "Combination of education with industrial production" (a type of school-to-work approach). Nine years later in 1857, the National Education Association (NEA, until 1870 called the National Teachers Association) was founded and emphasized the importance of teachers in children's education. Following this, California State Superintendent of Public Instruction John Swett in 1864 declared: "The vulgar impression that parents have a legal right to dictate to teachers is entirely erroneous...." In 1879, Illuminati member Kirchenrat Karl Kasimir Wundt's (code name Raphael) grandson, Wilhelm Wundt established the first laboratory in experimental psychology at the University of Leipzig (Pavlov studied there in 1884). The first of his American students was G. Stanley Hall, who would become John Dewey's mentor at Johns Hopkins University (where Dewey received his doctorate in 1884). Educational experimentalists James McKeen Cattell, Charles Judd and James Earl Russell also received doctorates from Wundt. Dewey later become known as the "Father of Progressive Education," even though Dewey himself used that appellation in reference to Francis Parker, who had studied the ideas of Pestalozzi when in Europe. Twelve years after receiving his doctorate, Dewey established in January 1896 his own laboratory school at the University of Chicago, an institution of higher learning well-endowed by John D. Rockefeller, Sr. This oil magnate in 1902 chartered the General Education Board, and appointed Frederick Gates (a Baptist minister) as chairman. Gates wrote Occasional Letter, No. 1 (published in THE WORLD'S WORK in 1912) in which he remarked: "In our dream, we have limitless resources, and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hand. The present educational conventions fade from our minds; and, unhampered by tradition, we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive rural folk." On October 12, 1917, THE NEW YORK TIMES published Judge John Hylan's comments about a letter by Dr. Abraham Flexner (Secretary of the General Education Board and formerly of the Carnegie Foundation describing a "secret conference" of New York City Board of Education's members to elect a board president who would institute a type of school-to-work outcome-based education program. Five years later, THE NEW YORK TIMES (March 27, 1922) covered a speech by Judge Hylan after he had become mayor of New York City.

In the summer of 1989, NCEE's Board of Trustees created the Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce to study the current and future skill needs of our nation's non-college workforce. The Commission then compiled a report, AMERICA'S CHOICE: HIGH SKILLS OR LOW WAGES!, which was released in June 1990.

A year later (1930), the "Dick and Jane" basal reading series begins, using the "look-say" or "whole word" method of reading instruction Up until this time, there was a high rate of literacy among the people of the United States, but the consequences of "progressive educators" using the "look-say" approach (instead of the highly successful intensive phonics method) will prove disastrous, causing a growing problem of illiteracy.

Likewise in 1991, the "Michigan Model" Common Core Curriculum was introduced. And from July 29 to August 4, teachers from around the country met at Snowmass, CO and produced dozens of performance tasks for students that "are tied to world-class standards that all students will need to meet," according the NCEE's president Marc Tucker. In a press release dated August 5, Colorado Gov. Roy Romer at Snowmass was quoted as saying that President Bush's proposal for a national student examination could lean heavily on the work of the New Standards Project.

By Dennis L. Cuddy, Ph.D. March 30, 2015 NewsWithViews.com Following the theme of the Illuminati and Common Core proponents that "they know what is best for the rest of us," Arthur Calhoun in `1919 authored the third volume in his series, A SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY, which became a widely used social service textbook. In it, he noted that "the child passes more and more into the custody of community experts," and he also elaborated that "the new view is that the higher and more obligatory relation is to society rather than to the family; the family goes back to the age of savagery while the state belongs to the age of civilization. The modern individual is a world citizen (a view of the Illuminati), served by the world, and home interests can no longer be supreme....As soon as the new family, consisting of only the parents and the children, stood forth, society saw how many were unfit for parenthood and began to realize the need for community care....As familism weakens, society has to assume a larger parenthood. The school begins to assume responsibility for the functions thrust upon it....The kindergarten grows downward toward the cradle and there arises talk of neighborhood nurseries....It seems clear that at least in its early stages, socialism will mean an increased amount of social control....We may expect in the socialist commonwealth a system of public educational agencies that will begin with the nursery and follow the individual through life....Those persons that experience alarm at the thought of intrinsic changes in family institutions should remember that in the light of social evolution, nothing is right or valuable in itself." Remember the above references to "cradle" and "follow the individual through life" when reading a later part of this series describing a letter written by National Center on Education and the Economy president Marc Tucker on November 11, 1992 to Hillary Clinton about Bill Clinton's presidential victory giving them a chance to implement their "cradle to grave" plan for everyone. In the 1920s, "Father of Progressive Education" (and later National Education Association honorary president) John Dewey went to the Soviet Union and authored an article in the December 5, 1928 edition of THE NEW REPUBLIC, in which he described "the marvelous development of progressive educational ideas and practices under the fostering care of the Bolshevist government...the required collective and cooperative mentality....The great task of the school is to counteract and transform those domestic and neighborhood tendencies...the influence of home and Church....In order to accomplish this end, the teachers must in the first place know with great detail and accuracy just what the conditions are to which pupils are subject in the home (remember this when reading about Common Core's collection of large amounts of personal data)....One of the most interesting pedagogical innovations...to discover the actual conditions that influence pupils in their out-of-school life...(is using) the themes of written work, the compositions of pupils, and also a detailed study throughout the year of home and family budgets....The institution of the family is being sapped indirectly rather than by frontal attack....There is no word one hears oftener than Gruppe, and all sorts of groups are instituted that militate against the primary social importance of the family unit. In consequence, to anyone who looks at the matter cold-bloodedly, free from sentimental associations clustering about the historic family institution, a most interesting sociological experimentation is taking place....Our special concern here is with the role of the schools in building up forces and factors whose natural effect is to undermine the importance and uniqueness of family life....The earliest section of the school system, dealing with children from three to seven, aims to keep children under its charge six, eight, and ten hours a day, and in ultimate ideal this procedure is to be universal and compulsory....Reference to this phase of Soviet education may perhaps be suitably concluded by a quotation from Lenin: 'We must declare openly what is concealed, namely, the political function of the school....It is to construct communist society.'" The next year (1929), Edward Thorndike (trained by Wundtians in the United States) and Arthur Gates authored ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATION, in which one reads: "Traditionally the elementary school has been primarily devoted to teaching the fundamental subjects, the three R's, and closely related disciplines....Artificial exercises, like drills on phonetics, multiplication tables, and formal writing movements, are used to a wasteful degree. Subjects such as arithmetic, language, and history include content that is intrinsically of little value...."

By Dennis L. Cuddy, Ph.D. May 25, 2015 NewsWithViews.com [Note: Rarely do I make a personal plea, but I am now. Many of you know that I have been taking care of my mother since she broke her femur in 5 places 9 years ago. On May 18, she became 91 years old, and I do all the cooking, cleaning, washing, etc. In the past 9 years, I have had a regular night's sleep only about 7 times due to all the necessary caregiving work. As a fulltime caregiver, I have not been able to have a typical salaried job, and if I worked and paid someone else to be a caregiver, I would have to pay them not much under $50,000 a year. So either way, I am out a lot of money. Recently, the Veterans Administration (VA) notified my mother that they had made a mistake, and she owed them over $7000 from her VA's widow's pension payment. Plus, the VA reduced her monthly pension payment to just $32. How is anyone supposed to buy food, etc. on that? Then just a few days ago, the owner of our condominium notified us that she is going to sell it. My mother has been in the hospital twice (for dehydration and a fall) in the last month, and a move at this time would not be helpful to her health. The only way to be sure she will not be forced to move is to buy the condominium, but I obviously do not have the money to do that. However, you could help me to make a down-payment and pay for other expenses, so anything you can send me (in care of NewsWithViews) would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.] In 1990, NCEE formed the National Alliance for Restructuring Education, which had the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF, founded by radical Saul Alinsky) produce a concept paper, "Engaging the Public: One Way to Organize." Remember what Alinsky wrote about community organizers "rubbing raw resentments" and "fanning latent hostilities." On May 23, 1991, the Bush administration presented to Congress the "America 2000 Excellence in Education Act," based on the 6 (later 8) national education goals and calling for a "national test" based on national standards. Although the test was supposed to be voluntary, the administration urged colleges to consider test results in their admissions decisions and employers to consider them when making hiring decisions. President Bush's Secretary of Education from 1991 to 1993 was Lamar Alexander, who endorsed the concept of "a brand new American school" that would be open from 6am to 6pm year-round. He said "these schools will serve children from age 3 months to 18. That may be a shocking thought to you, but if you were to do an inventory of every baby in your community, and think about what the needs of those babies were for the next four or five years, you might see that those needs might not be served any other way." Also in 1991, WE MUST TAKE CHARGE: OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR FUTURE, by Chester Finn was published. Finn had been head of the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Educational Research and Improvement. In the book, not only does Finn advocate a national curriculum, but he also stated that local control "has become an anachronism no longer justified by research, consistent with sound fiscal policy or organizational theory, suited to our mobility patterns, or important to the public." After reading the book, President Bush's Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander told Finn, "You saved me 6 months" in organizing the president's education initiative.

In 1972, UNESCO's bestseller LEARNING TO BE: THE WORLD OF EDUCATION TODAY AND TOMORROW was published. In this editor work, the authors say they are in search of a "new educational order...based on scientific and technological training, one of the essential components of scientific humanism." The book also emphasized relativity and dialectical thought, and proclaimed that "...an individual should avoid systematically setting up his beliefs and convictions...his behavior and customs as models or rules valid for all times." [Note: The situation in Baltimore looks like the Alinsky Model. Hillary Clinton wrote her senior thesis at Wellesley College on Saul Alinsky, and Barack Obama became a community organizer as a follower of Alinsky. There is an Acknowledgement to Lucifer at the front of Alinsky's RULES FOR RADICALS, and in that book, Alinsky says the community organizer should "rub raw the resentments of the community" and "fan the latent hostilities." Isn't that what occurred in Baltimore?] In the early 1970s, Michael Lerner (who would become an important adviser to Hillary Clinton) authored THE NEW SOCIALIST REVOLUTION, in which he proclaimed: "Education will be radically transformed in our socialist community...the main emphasis will be on learning how to... live and work collectively....The next level is learning some series of skills, for one's first set of jobs." And in Vladimir Turchenko's THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION AND THE REVOLUTION IN EDUCATION (1976) imported into the United States is described "linking instruction with productive labor" (this is similar to plank 10 of the COMMUNIST MANIFESTO mentioned earlier). The year after Turchenko's book appears in the United States, on November 17, 1977 U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education Mary Berry delivered an address, "The Chinese Experience in Education: What America Stands to Learn," at the University of Illinois. She revealed that the U.S. Office of Education was developing Lifelong Learning programs modeled after the Communist Chinese programs. Two years later, the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) was established under President Jimmy Carter, fulfilling a promise he had made to the NEA. In 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected president, taking office in January 1981. Over the next several years, Carter administration holdovers left the National Institute of Education (within USDOE). One of them, Marc Tucker (an NIE Associate Director) went to the newly established (early 1985) Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy (CFEE). This was after North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt had written an article in PHI DELTA KAPPAN (Fall 1984) advising linking education and the economy, and he suggested to David Hamburg (Carnegie Foundation CEO) that he fund a CFE (and Hunt became Vice-Chairman). The year after CFEE was begun, Mike Cohen left NIE in 1986 and went to the National Governors Association (NGA). About the same time, Ramsey Selden (who had opposed our efforts to have more intensive systematic phonics taught in schools) left NIE and went to the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) as one of their lead education personnel. The NGA (of which Hunt has been a chairman) and CCSSO would eventually be the lead organizations promoting Common Core. In the Winter 1987/88 edition of ACTION IN TEACHER EDUCATION, Professors Martin Haberman and James Collins wrote in "The Future of the Teaching Profession" that "schooling is now seen primarily as job training and, for this reason, quite comparable to schooling in non-democratic societies. Once education is redefined as a personal good and as emphasizing preparation for the world of work as its first purpose, our schools can appropriately be compared with those of the USSR." At the same time as Haberman's and Collins' article appeared, the CFEE changed its name to the National Center on Education and the Economy (NCEE) with board members including David Rockefeller, Jr. and Hillary Clinton. Early in 1989, NCEE produced TO SECURE OUR FUTURE: THE FEDERAL ROLE IN EDUCATION, which would play an important role in framing the issues and shaping the agreements that would be made at the Education Summit held at the University of Virginia (Charlottesville) in September 1989. George H.W. Bush (Skull & Bones member elected president in November 1988) and the governors of the 50 states met at the Summit and agreed to establish National Education Goals. Even though President Bush was a Republican and had many Republican governors from whom to choose, he selected Gov. Bill Clinton Rhodes scholar) to head the initial work. This is an example of how the Power Elite manages both the political left and right. Following the summit, the NGA would ask members of NCEE's staff to assist in the development of national education goals (6 but later 8). This process would culminate in the announcement of national education goals by President George H.W. Bush in his January 31,1990 State of the Union address.

In February 1990, the U.S. Department of Labor established the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS), which was charged with "defining a common core of skills that constitute job readiness in this new economic environment" (note the term "common core," and Gov. Hunt would title his program "JobReady"). In 1992, SCANS issued SKILLS AND TASKS FOR JOBS: A SCANS REPORT FOR AMERICA 2000. This is an example of why the American people should never let the national elite tell the rest of us what to do. On page 3-199 of the report under Responsibility (F13), it states the following: "Milk Cows. To perform this task, the farmer brings cows to a barn early in the morning and sets up milking equipment, and ensures proper operation. The farmer then brings the first cows into the milking parlor and feeds them by attaching milkers....Task ID#: 7131631." These "geniuses" actually said you feed cows by attaching milkers to them ! ï¿½ 2015 Dennis Cuddy - All Rights Reserved

Brownson further revealed that the connection between the Workingmen's Party, Robert Owen (father of Robert Dale Owen), Pestalozzi and Horace Mann is very important. In HORACE MANN: EDUCATIONAL STATESMAN, Heidelberg College (Ohio) Prof. E.I.F. Williams wrote: "The 'workingmen's movement' was an organization of the liberals in opposition to the conservative order....Its members were the radical wing of the Jacksonian democracy. In 1831 a large convention (of the Workingmen's Party) made up of farmers and workmen was held in Boston....Leaders such as Horace Mann (in Massachusetts)...urged their cause. Education was advanced as the surest and best method of advancing their aspirations....Labor leaders were enthusiastic about education in tax-supported schools....Education soon took first place among the reforms they demanded. They urged the necessity of an 'equal, universal, republican system of education.'...Reform was the watch-word of the day....More than two hundred communists Utopias were established....For two or three decades, they centered the attention of the country on socialistic and communistic schemes for human betterment. One of the most famous of the communities was established at New Harmony, Indiana by Robert Owen."

By Dennis L. Cuddy, Ph.D. July 27, 2015 NewsWithViews.com [Note: Polls are showing Donald Trump at or near the top in the Republican primary race for the presidency. However, have you considered the possibility that he is really the Democrats' (Hillary's) secret weapon? It is true that he has been critical of Hillary Clinton, but he is not saying anything other Republicans haven't said about her. So who is he really hurting with his comments about Sen. John McCain, Mexicans and others? The consensus is that his outbursts are severely harming "the Republican brand." But what if that's the whole purpose? He has even threatened to run as a third party candidate, which would guarantee a Democrat victory. What could be his motive for secretly causing the Democrats to win? It's obvious ! He's sympatico on important issues. For example, he has been very pro-abortion rights, and he has given money to leading liberal Democrats Hillary Clinton, Senators Harry Reid and Charles Schumer U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others! Just consider the possibility that Trump's candidacy is part of a secret Democrat (Hillary) plan!] Commenting on President Clinton's proposed national standards, two months after his State of the Union address, former head of the National Endowment for the Humanities Lynne Cheney wrote: "Whose National Standards?" (THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, April 2, 1997) referring to an earlier attempt to develop national history standards and stating: "Ninety-nine members of the U.S. Senate voted to reject history standards that would have students learning more about Joseph McCarthy than George Washington, more about Indian chief Speckled Snake than about Thomas Edison." The same is occurring under Common Core (CC) today. College Board (CB) president (and Rhodes Scholar) David Coleman announced the 34 Advanced Placement (AP) courses high school students take would be aligned with CC. Now AP teachers must teach the CB's "Framework" defining "the required knowledge of each period" in history. The CB website states that "all questions (in the AP exam) are derived from the course's stated objectives." In the "required knowledge" for the American Revolutionary period, there's no Jefferson, Adams, Madison or Franklin. In the Civil War period, there's no Gettysburg Address. In the World War II period, there's no Hitler, D-Day or Truman. Regarding the Civil Rights movement, there's no Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks, etc. The primary entity promoting CC has been Achieve, which was founded in 1996. Its first president was Robert Schwartz (who had worked at NIE where I worked), and one of its first co-chairmen (from 1996-2002) was IBM's former CEO Lewis Gerstner. Shortly after Achieve was founded, Gerstner made an announcement that indicated that he and other CEO's would consider locating/expanding or not their corporations' facilities in a particular place in the U.S. based upon whether the locality or state had adopted Achieve's internationally benchmarked standards! Relevant to these internationally benchmarked, most people do not realize that CC is part of a much larger international effort. As part of a New Transatlantic Agreement, on May 5-6, 1997 the U.S. and the European Union convened a major conference, "Bridging the Atlantic: People-to-People Links" calling for "thematic networks for curriculum development" and stating that "governments too are obliged to adapt their economic, training and social welfare programs." The "Partners in a Global Economy Working Group" of the conference discussed "what redesigning of curricula is required...(i.e., what career skills are needed)...." At this time, on the National Skill Standards Board website was mention of a report by the Tavistock Institute for the European Commission. The report was completed in October 1997 and described the relevancy of Goals 2000, SCANS typology with its "profound implications for the curriculum and training changes that this will require" and what skills standards and portable credentials "benchmarked to international standards...." As the movement toward global education increased, George W. Bush was elected president, taking office in 2001, and his Secretary of Education Rod Paige on October 3, 2003 in Paris stated: "The United States is pleased to return to UNESCO....Our governments have entrusted us with the responsibility of preparing our children to become citizens of the world." President Obama would later refer to himself as a citizen of the world, but the problem with this concept, as opposed to resident or inhabitant of the world, is that "citizenship" entails legal obligations. And world citizenship obligations would trump those of national citizenship. On November 17, 2004 at UNESCO's headquarters in Paris, UNESCO signed a 26-page "Cooperation Agreement" with Microsoft (Bill Gates founder and CEO) to develop a "master curriculum" for teacher training and information technologies based on standards, guidelines, benchmarks and assessment techniques. Gates initialed every page and agreed that this curriculum was to reflect UNESCO's values. These values were explained in first UNESCO Director-General Sir Julian Huxley's UNESCO: ITS PURPOSE AND ITS PHILOSOPHY as including "a scientific world humanism, global in extent and evolutionary in background" with "transfer of full sovereignty from separate nations to a world organization...political unification in some sort of world government would be required...." The next year (2005), Bill Gates funded the New Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce (created by NCEE president Marc Tucker). And in 2008, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded the International Benchmarking Advisory Group report for CC standards on behalf of the National Governors Association (NGA), Council of Chief State School Officers, and Achieve titled "Benchmarking for Success: Ensuring U.S. Students Receive a World-Class Education" showing the U.N. is a member of the Common Core Advisory Group (also see "How Bill Gates pulled off the Common Core revolution" in THE WASHINGTON POST, June 8, 2014).

In February 1990, the U.S. Department of Labor established the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS), which was charged with "defining a common core of skills that constitute job readiness in this new economic environment" (note the term "common core," and Gov.

By Dennis L. Cuddy, Ph.D. June 8, 2015 NewsWithViews.com [Note. In my NewsWithViews column for April 15, 2013, I predicted that terrorists could set an apartment complex in this country on fire at night, and on May 27, 2015, the LOS ANGELES TIMES reported that the L.A. Police Department's anti-terrorism division arrested Dawud Abdulwali "on suspicion of arson in connection with a fire that destroyed a downtown Los Angeles apartment complex" on December 8, 2014 at 1:20am (night). Abdulwali may have been a "lone wolf," but he may also have been prompted by ISIS, which was looking at how long it took for him to be found and arrested. The time between the fire and his arrest was about 170 days. Suppose ISIS now calculated one of its members here could have as many as 170 days to set as many apartment or forest fires as possible!] Hillary Clinton and Ira Magaziner were on the board of NCEE which wanted, according to A HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PLAN (1992), a "national system of education in which curriculum, pedagogy, examinations and teacher education and licensure systems are all linked to the national standards, and the standards are the same everywhere." Also in 1992, NCEE president Marc Tucker co-authored THINKING FOR A LIVING: WORK SKILLS AND FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, in which he wrote: "As this is written (1992), the former members of the Communist bloc in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union are setting out to fashion new societies....Many of those countries have done a better job than we of building effective human resource development programs, and for that reason, may yet surprise the world in economic prowess." On August 2, 1992, Assistant Labor Secretary Roberts Jones announced that the federal government was preparing to deny aid and student loans to schools that fail to prepare their graduates with the skills needed to compete for jobs in the modern workplace, saying "This is a touchy subject." Three months later, NCEE president Marc Tucker wrote a revealing letter to his board member Hilary Clinton on November 11, 1992 saying he had just come from David Rockefeller, Jr.'s office where they were "celebrating" Bill Clinton's election as president, as that would allow putting into place their agenda to integrate education into a national system of "human resources development...from cradle to grave...(for) everyone....We propose that Bill (Clinton) take a leaf out of the German book" (regarding required) "apprenticeship slots." Relevant to Tucker's letter, American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Lynne Cheney wrote in her April 2, 1997 article "Whose National Standards?" in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: "Undersecretary of Education Mike Smith has worked closely with the NCEE. Like Robert Schwartz, then head of educational giving for the Pew Foundation, Mr. Smith was among those whom NCEE president Marc Tucker brought together right after the 1992 election to advise Mrs. Clinton. After the meeting Mr. Tucker wrote an 18-page letter to "Dear Hillary" advising that the Clintons aim to " remold the entire American system" of education and training. Crucial to spinning a "seamless web" of education and labor policy that would envelop all Americans "from cradle to grave," Mr. Tucker wrote, are "clear national standards of performance." The result of the Tucker-Clinton plan was that Tucker's ally at the National Institute of Education (where I worked) within the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), Mike Cohen, wrote Goals 2000 for President Clinton's Secretary of Education Richard Riley, for whom Cohen was a Special Assistant for several years after working for the National Governors Association (NGA). On April 21, 1993 President Clinton transmitted the "Goals 2000: Educate America Act," to Congress. Title I of the legislation "codified into law the 6 (later 8) national goals." Title II of the legislation dealt with national education standards and assessments. And Title IV established a National Skill Standards Board. One of the Board members was Carolyn Warner, who as the State Superintendent of Education for Arizona said that "those who educate are more to be honored than those who bear the children. The latter gave them only life, the former teach them the art of living" (ARIZONA REPUBLIC, January 7, 1975). Commenting on the legislation, Dianne Ravitch (Assistant Secretary of OERI during the Bush administration) wrote in the May 26, 1993 NEW YORK TIMES "Clinton's Math: More Gets Less," in which she stated: "The Clinton administration's school reform bill would expand dramatically the scope and cost of federal regulation of local schools....To satisfy Congressional critics, the Administration revised its bill, laying the foundation for an interventionist Federal role in local schooling....At the heart of the bill is a powerful new agency, called the National Education Standards and Improvement Council, which would function like a national school baord. It would certify national curriculum standards, state tests and state 'opportunty to learn' standards."

(In an upcoming part of this series, NEA president Catherine Barrett will make a similar comment in 1973.) Pursuing these "progressive education" attitudes, Thorndike will produce new spellers, math texts, dictionaries, and textbooks on education and educational testing.

Of course, if there were to be a world government, something would have to be done to bring capitalist and communist governments together. In 1953 Ford Foundation president H. Rowan Gaither told Norman Dodd (research director for the Congressional Reece Committee) that the foundation was operating under directives from the White House "to the effect that we should make every effort to so alter life in the United States as to make possible a comfortable merger with the Soviet Union."

In the speech, Mayor Hylan said: "The warning of Theodore Roosevelt has much timeliness today, for the real menace of our republic is this invisible government which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy length over city, State and nation....The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States Government for their own selfish purposes....These international bankers and Rockefeller-Standard Oil interests control the majority of newspapers and magazines in this country." Mayor Hylan quoted from Frederick Gates' paper mentioned above, and then said "This is the kind of education the coolies receive in China, but we are not going to stand for it in these United States. One of my first acts as Mayor was to pitch out, bag and baggage, from the educational system of our city the Rockefeller agents and the Gary plan of education to fit the children for the mill and factory."

By Dennis L. Cuddy, Ph.D. March 2, 2015 NewsWithViews.com There is a great controversy today over the current educational reform movement known as Common Core (CC). Many people have offered specific criticisms of the movement, but they generally look at CC in isolation. However, it is important to understand the back ground of CC, and a good starting point for that begins with the Illuminati, which began on May 1, 1776. The fundamental purpose of the Illuminati was to do away with existing authority (e.g., monarchical, religious, etc.) and adopt the principle of its founder, Adam Weishaupt, which was that they, the Illuminati or Enlightened, knew what was best for people. The leaders of CC today also believe they know, even better than parents, what is best in education for children in the United States. Relevant to education, certain members of the Illuminati became tutors to princes, who would then become czars, kings, etc. (e.g., Alexander I of Russia) and be under the influence of the Illuminati. In terms of what we know today as elementary and secondary education, Illuminati member Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (a Swiss, code-named Alfred) had the greatest influence. According to Will Monroe's HISTORY OF THE PESTALOZZIAN METHOD IN THE UNITED STATES (1907), the educational ideas of Pestalozzi began to be printed in journals and textbooks in the United States in 1806. They began to be used in some school systems, especially in New England where they were viewed favorably be the intelligentsia of Horace Mann's day. This was the first half of the 1800s, and Mann became known as the "Father of the American Public Education." Utopian Socialist Robert Owen visited Pestalozzi at Yverdon, Switzerland in 1818, and applied the Illuminist's educational principles in Britain and America. In 1825, Owen established the first commune in the United States in New Harmony, Indiana. Joining Owen in 1828 was Frances Wright (formerly Madame Francoise D'Arusmont from France) who, with Owen's son Robert Dale Owen and Orestes Brownson, formed the Workingmen's Party in New York. According to A CONCISE HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC (vol. 1) by Samuel Morison, Henry Steele Commager, and William Leuchtenburg, Frances Wright became "a lecture-platform apostle of...a system which she called 'National, Rational, Republican Education, Free for All, at the Expense of All, Conducted under the Guardianship of the State,' apart from the contaminating influence of parents." After Brownson became a Christian, he revealed in THE WORKS OF ORESTES BROWNSON (20 volumes) that their plan in establishing their political party was as follows: "The great object was to get rid of Christianity, and to convert our churches into halls of science. The plan was not to make open attacks upon religion, although we might belabor the clergy and bring them into contempt where we could; but to establish a system of state---we said national---schools, from which all religion was to be excluded, in which nothing was to be taught except such knowledge as is verifiable by the senses, and to which all parents were to be compelled by law to send their children. Our complete plan was to take the children from their parents at the age of 12 or 18 months, and to have them nursed, fed, clothed, and trained in these schools at the public expense; but at any rate, we were to have godless schools for all the children of the country....The plan has been successfully pursued...,and the whole action of the country on the subject has taken the direction we sought to give it. One of the principal movers of the scheme had no mean share in organizing the Smithsonian Institute."

By Dennis L. Cuddy, Ph.D. April 13, 2015 NewsWithViews.com Four years after the look-say "Dick and Jane" basal reading series was introduced, in 1934 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS (the last of a 17-volume study concerning American education) of the Commission on Social Studies of the American Historical association was published. The work of the Commission was financed ($340,000) by the Carnegie Corporation. Commenting on the document in THE NEW REPUBLIC article "A New Education for A New America" (July 29, 1936), British Socialist Professor Harold Laski remarked that the volume contained "a content of teaching which frankly admits that the age of government control has arrived....For, at bottom, and stripped of its carefully neutral phrases, the report is an educational program for a socialist America." Two years after Laski wrote this, on March 1, 1938, according to George Mosse's NAZI CULTURE in the chapter "The Key: Education of Youth," under the Nazis (National Socialists), "the textbooks were increasingly National Socialist, the teachers were regimented....The individual states were abolished....The Nazis attempted to unify the school system, as they 'meshed the gears' of all other activities in the Third Reich....Changes in the curriculum brought all schools closer together....Social pressures aided the Nazis in getting rid of the influence of the older generation...." Under Common Core, assessments drive curricula to unify nationally education in America, and school systems' teachers become to a certain extent regimented in preparing students for the assessments (getting correct answers is not enough, but also knowing how), whether in individual classrooms or for the College Boards. "Getting rid of the influence of the older generation" in the United States was also important for the power elite. And the way to do this was through "critical thinking." Three years after the Nazis began the educational program mentioned above, Edward Glaser authored AN EXPERIMENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL THINKING (1941). It was one the first books on the subject and followed the psychodrama and sociometry work of Rumanian psychiatrist Jacob Moreno in the early part of the 20th century. Critical thinking developed into critiquing, which in turn developed into criticizing the values of "the older generation." The purpose was to establish a "generation gap," with the new generation adopting more humanistic than Biblical values. By the end of World War II, the National Education Association (NEA) was promoting world government. In the NEA JOURNAL (January 1946), Joy Elmer Morgan (editor of the NEA JOURNAL, 1921-1955) wrote "The Teacher and World Government," in which he proclaimed: "In the struggle to establish an adequate world government, the teacher...can do much to prepare the hearts and minds of children for global understanding and cooperation....At the very top of all the agencies which will assure the coming of world government must stand the school, the teacher, and the organized profession." Similarly two years later, Sir Julian Huxley (first director-general of UNESCO) authored UNESCO: ITS PURPOSE AND ITS PHILOSOPHY (1948), in which he wrote of UNESCO's educational program that it could "stress the ultimate need for world political unity and familiarize all peoples with the implications of the transfer of full sovereignty from separate nations to a world organization...political unification in some sort of world government will be required...."

Concerning Achieve, in January 2003 Mike Cohen had become the new head of this organization. He had been director of education policy at the NGA (1986-1990), director of the National Alliance for Restructuring Education (1990-1993), senior adviser to U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley under President Clinton. He was detailed to the White House from 1996 to 1999, and then became U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education for Elementary and Secondary Education (1999-2001). Under Cohen, Achieve "formed the Partnership for the Assessment of College and Career Readiness (PARCC), one of the two organizations developing common assessments, and helped develop Common Core State Standards" (see www.achieve.org/michael-cohen).

Mike Cohen mentioned above was "detailed" on June 28,1996 from the U.S. Department of Education to the White House to become President Clinton's advisor on education. In that position, Cohen was able to exert great influence upon the President's February 4, 1997 "State of the Union" address, in which the president delivered a "Call to Action" concerning education, calling for "national standards representing what all our students must know to succeed in the knowledge economy of the 21st century. Every state and school must shape the curriculum to reflect these standards....To help students meet the standards and measure their progress, we will lead an effort over the next two years to develop national tests of student achieve in reading and math."

By Dennis L. Cuddy, Ph.D. May 11, 2015 NewsWithViews.com

On March 26, 1994, the U.S. Senate passed the legislation (the House passed it earlier), and Goals 2000 became law with 8 goals codified, and provision for a National Education Standards and Improvement Council, which would certify "what all students should know and be able to do" and certify "national content and student performance standards." These last provisions amounted to the widely objectionable "outcome-based education," which would later be combined with "school-to-work" to form the basis of Common Core. In 1994, Sen. Ted Kennedy's School-to-Work Opportunities Act also passed Congress.

COMMON CORE PART 4

**********************************************************************************************************

A few months later, in the March 1992 edition of EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP, an article titled "Will America Choose High Skills or Low wages" by Ira Magaziner (Rhodes scholar) and Hillary Clinton was published, in which they referred to President Bush's education initiative, "America 2000," announcing the development of a national examination system for the nation's K-12 school systems.

As mentioned earlier, "Father of Progressive Education" John Dewey very much admired what the Soviets (remember that the second S in USSR stands for Socialist) were doing. He taught at Columbia University from 1905 to 1930, and by the early 1950s, the Deweyites had taken control of Columbia's Teachers College. In A HISTORY OF TEACHERS COLLEGE: COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY (1954), Lawrence Cremin et al explained that "the single most powerful education force in the world is at 120th Street and Broadway in New York City. Your children's teachers go there for advanced training....With one hundred thousand alumni, TC has managed to seat about one-third of the presidents and deans now (1953) in office at accredited U.S. teaching training schools. Its graduates make up about twenty percent of all our public school teachers. Over a fourth of the superintendents of schools in the one-hundred sixty-eight U.S. cities with at least fifty thousand population are TC-trained."

By Dennis L. Cuddy, Ph.D. April 27, 2015 NewsWithViews.com [Note: Just like Skull & Bones (S&B) member John Kerry was the designated loser (he could have challenged the vote in Ohio, but he didn't) to fellow S&B member George W. Bush in 2004, now Lincoln Chafee (classmate of Jeb Bush at Phillips Academy in Andover, MA) has entered the Democratic race for the presidency against Hillary Clinton. Chafee's role is to oppose Hillary from the left, thereby dampening leftist support for her in the general election. I have already written how Hillary was "dirtied up" with Benghazi (and more recently by her emails), and how potential Republican threats to Jeb such as Perry in Texas, Christie in New Jersey, and McDonald in Virginia were "dirtied up" as well. Recently, Jeb's Florida friend Sen. Marco Rubio has entered the Republican race which will split the Hispanic vote with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. This is like Teddy Roosevelt split the vote with William Howard Taft allowing Woodrow Wilson to be elected president in 1912, and Ross Perot took enough votes away from George H.W. Bush in 1992 so Bill Clinton was elected president. Additionally in the 2016 race, Rand Paul will siphon off the libertarian Republican voters, all of which will allow Jeb Bush to win some early primaries with only a plurality (nowhere near a majority) of votes. Jeb's team will also see to it that conservative Republicans' love for Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin will be dampened by showing his lack of knowledge of foreign affairs and asking such questions as "If Scott Walker is really a conservative, why does he say he admires/respects Bill Clinton's Secretary of State Madeline Albright?" Another example of how the global power elite runs things is the fact that President Obama is lining up with Congressional Republicans and against his own Party regarding authorization for the currently discussed Pacific trade deal. When it comes to the global economy, presidents whether Democratic or Republican are told what to do by the global power elite. For those who read my last column on April 13, you will want to read the last paragraph again as something has been added.] Relevant to the effort to move us toward a "comfortable merger" with the Soviet Union as mentioned above, in 1960 HEW published SOVIET EDUCATION PROGRAMS, wherein one reads: "...wherever we went, we felt the pulse of the Soviet government's desire to educate and train a new generation of technically skilled citizens....USSR plans to bring all secondary school children into labor education and training experiences through the regular school program." Beginning in the early 1960s, the Deweyites in control of education in the United States moved the emphasis in education from the cognitive domain (basics of reading, math, etc.) to the affective domain (social relationships, feelings, etc.). Grade inflation and social promotions began along with a fall in SAT scores. The educational elite said that the "new math" would help the United States to lead the world in the future (similar to Common Core proponents today saying students will have more depth of understanding), but it turned out to be a disaster. Following the shift away from the basics, NEA president Catherine Barrett in the early 1970s in SATURDAY REVIEW OF EDUCATION remarked that : "Dramatic changes in the way we will raise our children in the year 2000 are indicated, particularly in terms of schooling....We will need to recognize that the so-called 'basic skills,' which currently represent nearly the total effort in elementary schools, will be taught in one-quarter of the present school day....When this happens---and it's near---the teacher can rise to his true calling. More than dispenser of information, the teacher will be a conveyor of values, a philosopher....We will be agents of change." Furthermore, Carolyn Warner, Arizona State Superintendent of Public Instruction, was quoted in the ARIZONA REPUBLIC (January 7, 1975) as saying that "those who educate are more to be honored than those who bear the children. The latter gave them only life, the former teach them the art of living."

The Second Amendment Represents

********************************************************************************************************

“Let her and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter?”--Milton, Areopagitica

The Second Amendment states, "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." * * * The time has come for action regarding the Second Amendment -- the right to keep and bear arms. The Second Amendment has enemies because freedom has enemies. Let me tell you, even if you never own or even want to own a gun, it is vital, it is indispensable to you, whether or not you ever do actually own a gun, that you are truly able to exercise your right to keep and bear arms. Your right to keep and bear arms represents the fact that the government works for you, not you for the government. The fact that some of our leaders want to make laws that infringe on your right to keep and bear arms vividly demonstrates the fact that they want you to work for them. Thomas Jefferson made it ever so clear when he said that, "Those who hammer their swords into plowshares will work for those who do not." The colonial patriots hammered their plowshares into swords because they knew that they had the right to the freedom of self-determination, as so eloquently expressed in the Declaration of Independence as the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The battle for freedom continues. I assure you that as they very carefully chip away at the Bill of Rights, those anti-gun leaders want to put you in chains. And those anti-gun laws of theirs are obvious links in those chains. We all need to remember that history has clearly and repeatedly shown that disarming the law abiding citizens is the essential first step in creating a police state. Also, they wish the Second Amendment gone because its removal would be a great representational disempowering. As part of overpowering Federal control, anti-gun leaders desire its removal as a stepping stone on the pathway to nullifying the Bill of Rights in its entirety. The forces of evil seek to destroy our precious fundamentals. The slightest diminishing of an element of the Bill of Rights becomes a precedent -- a point of leverage toward the elimination of Freedom. The end of Liberty. As your Congressman, I will continue to fight for your right to keep and bear arms. Now, in many ways the pen is mightier than the sword. So, I strongly encourage you to use your pen in writing letters to your legislators and your local newspapers-- as you join the battle for freedom. The time has come.

Lest we forget at least an over-the-shoulder acknowledgment to the very first radical:from all our legends, mythology, and history (and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins -- or which is which), the very first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom --Lucifer. --SAUL ALINSKY

The following words appear on the page preceding the "Contents" page of Saul D. Alinsky's, RULES FOR RADICALS .

*******************************************************************************************************

Utahns Against Common Core Common Core Violates 3 Federal Laws--July 11, 2012 Common Core as currently implemented directly violates or comes to the very edge of the line of these three federal laws. Particularly the last one below is in process of being violated as states are required to incur costs of this implementation that are not funded by the federal government (AKA taxpayer money). From the General Education Provisions Act (20 USC § 1232a) -- See Below “No provision of any applicable program shall be construed to authorize any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system, or over the selection of library resources, textbooks, or other printed or published instructional materials by any educational institution or school system, or to require the assignment or transportation of students or teachers in order to overcome racial imbalance.” From the Department of Education Organization Act (20 USC § 3403(b)) “No provision of a program administered by the Secretary or by any other officer of the Department shall be construed to authorize the Secretary or any such officer to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system, over any accrediting agency or association, or over the selection or content of library resources, textbooks, or other instructional materials by any educational institution or school system, except to the extent authorized by law.” From the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (20 USC 7907(a)) “Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize an officer or employee of the Federal Government to mandate, direct, or control a State, local educational agency, or school’s curriculum, program of instruction, or allocation of State and local resources, or mandate a State or any subdivision thereof to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for under this Act.”

Regarding Robert Creamer: Served 5 months in prison (and 11 months in house arrest) for tax evasion and bank fraud While in prison, he wrote a book that later served as a blueprint for Democrat proposals for universal health care. Calls for the “democratization of wealth” in America, and for “progressive control of governments around the world” Advocates amnesty for illegal aliens

Creamer identified immigration as an issue that “will have an enormous impact on the battle for power between the progressive and conservative forces in American society.” He said: “If the Democrats continue to stand firmly for immigrant rights, the issue will define immigrants’ voting loyalties for a generation. If we are successful, a gigantic block of progressive votes will enter the electorate over the next 15 years—a block that could be decisive in the battle for the future.” Mirroring his approach to health care, Creamer stressed the importance of persuading religious leaders to lobby, on moral grounds, in favor of amnesty and expanded rights for illegal aliens. Born in 1948, Robert Creamer is the husband of Democrat Rep. Jan Schakowsky. He formerly served as executive director of the Illinois Public Action Fund (where his wife was the program director), and subsequently as a leader of Citizen Action/Illinois. He was also a lobbyist for George Soros’s Open Society Institute. Today Creamer heads the Strategic Consulting Group, a political consultancy whose list of clients includes ACORN, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the AFL-CIO, the United Steelworkers Union of America, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and dozens of other leftist or Democratic Party state organizations. Pursuant to an FBI investigation, Creamer in 2006 was indicted for bank fraud and tax evasion. During his trial, he received some 200 letters of support from such notables as Richard Durbin, Carol Browner, Jesse Jackson, and David Axelrod. Creamer ultimately was sentenced to five months in federal prison plus eleven months of house arrest. Upon his sentencing, he publicly pledged: “For the rest of my life I will continue to do whatever I can to work for social and economic justice.” While incarcerated -- or on “forced sabbatical,” as he called it -- Creamer wrote a 628-page political manual titled Stand Up Straight! How Progressives Can Win (published in 2007). In the Acknowledgements section of the book, Creamer stated that his political views had been deeply influenced by “the legendary community organizer” Saul Alinsky. Stand Up Straight! advanced the notion that the Democratic Party could win a permanent majority in Congress by doing the following: passing a national health care bill, thereby turning more people into wards of an ever-expanding government, and of the party that works to grow government; and giving amnesty to all illegal immigrants, thereby creating, virtually overnight, a large new constituency of Democratic voters. The author conceded that his desire “to reshape the structure of one-sixth of the American economy” (i.e., the health care sector) was contingent upon the Democrats being able to control 60 votes in the U.S. Senate, and upon the election of a “progressive Democrat” to the White House -- conditions that could, in Creamer's estimation, be achieved by the year 2009. Notably, his book was effusive in its praise of then-Senator Barack Obama. Creamer's book advocated a “public plan” that would guarantee every U.S. resident's “right” to health care; this plan eventually would serve as a model for the “public option” in subsequent legislative proposals by Congressional Democrats. In addition, Creamer laid out a “Progressive Agenda for Structural Change,” which included a ten-point plan to set the stage for implementing universal health care: “We must create a national consensus that health care is a right, not a commodity; and that government must guarantee that right.” “We must create a national consensus that the health care system is in crisis.” “Our messaging program over the next two years should focus heavily on reducing the credibility of the health insurance industry and focusing on the failure of private health insurance.” “We need to systematically forge relationships with large sectors of the business/employer community.” “We need to convince political leaders that they owe their elections, at least in part, to the groundswell of support of [sic] universal health care, and that they face political peril if they fail to deliver on universal health care in 2009.” “We need not agree in advance on the components of a plan, but we must foster a process that can ultimately yield consensus.” “Over the next two years, we must design and organize a massive national field program.” “We must focus especially on the mobilization of the labor movement and the faith community.” “We must systematically leverage the connections and resources of a massive array of institutions and organizations of all types.” “To be successful, we must put in place commitments for hundreds of millions of dollars to be used to finance paid communications and mobilization once the battle is joined.” “To win,” added Creamer, “we must not just generate understanding, but emotion—fear, revulsion, anger, disgust.” Beyond the narrow specifics of health care, Creamer in his book advocated the “democratization of wealth” in America and “progressive control of governments around the world.” Creamer also identified immigration as an issue that “will have an enormous impact on the battle for power between the progressive and conservative forces in American society.” He said: “If the Democrats continue to stand firmly for immigrant rights, the issue will define immigrants’ voting loyalties for a generation. If we are successful, a gigantic block of progressive votes will enter the electorate over the next 15 years—a block that could be decisive in the battle for the future.” Mirroring his approach to health care, Creamer stressed the importance of persuading religious leaders to lobby, on moral grounds, in favor of amnesty and expanded rights for illegal aliens. Stand Up Straight! was endorsed by a number of leading Democrats and their political allies, including: Greg Galluzzo, director of the Gamaliel Foundation; SEIU president Andrew Stern, who said the book would “hopefully inspire more people to act”; political strategist David Axelrod, who said it “provides a blueprint for future victories”; Democrat operative John Podesta, who called the book a “straight-up shot in the arm for progressives”; political commentator Arianna Huffington, who said it would help “return America to its progressive roots”; and Congressman John Lewis, who said the book would help “create our society’s next historical movement.” In 2008 Creamer worked for the Obama presidential campaign, training volunteers at “Camp Obama.” Today Creamer writes periodically for the Huffington Post. On November 19, 2009, he penned a piece that said: “If we succeed in winning health insurance reform we will have breached the gates of the status quo. We will demonstrate that fundamental change is possible. Into that breach will flow a wave of progressive change.” On November 24, 2009, Creamer attended a White House state dinner -- along with high-level Obama advisors like Andrew Stern and David Axelrod -- despite the fact that ex-convicts are usually barred from such events. In a December 2009 interview, Creamer said the following with regard to Senator Joseph Lieberman's objection to government-run healthcare: "The problem with Lieberman is .... he has kind of the suicide-bomber kind of advantage. He doesn't care if he blows the whole house down. The best option for him, to a healthcare bill, is no bill; that's fine [with him]. He doesn't care if there's no bill, because the insurance industry is happy to have no bill. And he is happy--gleeful to try and punish the left wing of the party that he believes wronged him." When the interviewer interjected that Lieberman was "a vindictive, spiteful, little, miserable man who is taking a lot of money from the insurance industry, Creamer said, "Absolutely miserable."
