★Andrew Heldut★

Attorney Andrew Heldut is an Associate Attorney at McGuire Law, P.C., a top leading class action litigation law firm located in downtown Chicago with a focus on protecting the rights of American consumers nationwide and the rights of citizens. Member of the Chicago Bar Association & the Illinois State Bar Association, he obtained his Juris Doctor from the University of Illinois at Chicago's John Marshall Law School. He also holds a Joint Honors Degree in Economics and Politics from the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, United Kingdom.

Heldut For Congress

We can do better.

We must level the playing field for fair and equal opportunity for all Americans to live up to our American creed of egalitarianism and keep our generations safe from real problems. We are done listening. We are getting big money out of politics. We are calling for Term Limits. We are coming to action to save our Nation and our Planet.

We are using the latest technological advances for grassroots organizing. Reach out! We'd be happy to hear from you.

During his university time in Scotland, Heldut founded a non-profit international venture called the Sustainable Village Initiative dealing with development and women empowerment issues in Ghana. It's now the Institute for the Development and Preservation of Culture and Self-Sufficiency (www.idpcs.org).

It seems they are destined to never break the partisan divide, unless we create a brand new Congress. Currently, we the millennials feel left out from Democratic and Republican policies. With the horrific shootings in schools, churches & synagogues where innocent human beings and kids are dying and nothing is being done about it. With tax cuts and now the bailouts for the rich, which America did not need, and yet we have tremendous student loans where one may never pay it off. By being the richest nation on this planet and we still have no universal basic healthcare? With fear being imposed on us to worry about immigrants and criminals, rather than addressing the real problems of inequality, racial justice, and climate change. Inequality is growing on an unprecedented scale, which means that more and more people cannot afford a normal life, living from paycheck to paycheck and putting themselves in more debt through high interest credit, a credit which they need to make ends meet.

Heldut is engaged in U.S. politics having interned for Senator Dick Durbin where he dealt directly with many Illinois constituents in regards to veteran and immigration issues. Andrew Heldut also interned for Hillary's Presidential political campaign in the fundraising and event office covering the Midwest in her Chicago headquarters and worked on other campaigns including that of Alderman Sophia King, where he was the precinct chairman.

Where is the pro-life in any of this?

Andrew has also been involved in the blockchain arena since 2013. Now the President of the Government Blockchain Association of the Illinois State Chapter, the GBA has been bringing business and political leaders, policy makers, and non-governmental organizations together with the aim of making government more efficient and transparent.

This stagnates the older generations of politicians.

Andrew is Polish-American born in Chicago. Fluent in Polish, Andrew was the Vice-President of the Polish-American Law Association at his law school. Andrew joined the John Marshall Pro Bono Law Clinic which provides free legal services to those who cannot afford legal representation. Andrew handled vast amount of cases including civil rights, prisoner rights, post-conviction relief, expungements & sealing, fair housing issues, foreclosure defense, estates & trusts, and veteran cases.

By observing the political process for many years, it is clear to me: our country has so much hatred and irrational partisanship, dividing the political process to a point of stagnation. Big money, big interests, ill-will, prejudices and ignorance dictate our policy.
