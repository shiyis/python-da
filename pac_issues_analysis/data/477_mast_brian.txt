Serving my country is all I ever really wanted to do. It runs in my blood from my father to my uncles. My wife Brianna and I pray that one day our children will find the same passion. I am humbled and honored to fight for you as your Congressman from Florida’s 18th congressional district. I strive to serve you in Congress as I did on the battlefield: without regard for personal gain or personal sacrifice.

PAID FOR BY MAST FOR CONGRESS

Our elected “leaders” usually spend far too much time talking and not nearly enough time listening. This has led to a failed status quo that puts self-interest ahead of what’s in the best American interests. As your representative in Congress, I want to hear from you about the issues that matter most to your daily life so that I can be the best representative for our community possible.

The most important issue for our community is the devastation of our water. This impacts everyone: businesses forced to close, people getting sick, animals killed, and our environment destroyed. Health and safety needs to be made a top priority to prevent these discharges.

We all know our immigration system, illegal and legal, is broken. For far too long, politicians in Washington haven’t had the will to fix it. For starters, we must secure the border and prevent visa overstays.

As a former combat soldier based in Afghanistan, I have seen the enemy face to face. I also know the war we are in is not only a war of military force; it is a war of ideology. I am committed to quickly rebuild our military and put our troops on the front line in the best possible position to succeed.

Our elected “leaders” usually spend far too much time talking and not nearly enough time listening. This has led to a failed status quo that puts self-interest ahead of what’s in the best American interests. As your representative in Congress, I want to hear from you about the issues that matter most to your daily life so that I can be the best representative for our community possible.

I see my mission in Congress the same way I saw it in the military: keeping Americans safe. That’s why I’ve made community safety, health, and strength top priorities during my time in Congress.

Following my service in the Army, I volunteered alongside the IDF in Israel because I know that a strong Israel is the only path to a stable Middle East. I believe we must continue to repair the U.S. – Israel Relationship that was strained under the previous Administration.

Our current spending is unsustainable, which is why I’ve voted against irresponsible spending packages. We must pass a Balance Budget Amendment that will force government to live within its means. The tax cuts passed have allowed you to keep more of your money, stimulated the economy, and led to more investment.

Mandates from Washington don’t work. Instead, each state should be a laboratory for innovation. School choice is also a very important issue for me so parents can decide which school is best for their children.

As a father of four beautiful children with a fourth on the way, I’m a strong supporter of the right to life. I believe we must defend life at every stage and protect the most vulnerable members of our society.

Washington, DC wastes far too much money on programs that don’t benefit the American people. I pride myself on being a taxpayer watchdog and supporting efforts to make the federal government more efficient, effective, and accountable.

We must fight for working families by expanding opportunities and creating an economic environment that allows for job growth. The explosive growth of government regulations during the previous Administration hurt both economic growth and job creation.

Every veteran who the VA serves must be treated as the most important veteran to ever be served. Anything less is unacceptable because every veteran who has sworn the oath, worn the uniform, and offered to give the last beat of their heart cannot be taken for granted.

I have carried a rifle and a pistol for most of my adult life and fired both in defense of every American and myself. The right to defend ourselves is God-given.

I will always protect Social Security and Medicare, ensuring our government keeps the promises it has made to current retirees and those planning to retire. I absolutely do not support cutting benefits for current retirees or anybody nearing retirement.

The most important issue for our community is the devastation of our water. This impacts everyone: businesses forced to close, people getting sick, animals killed, and our environment destroyed. Health and safety needs to be made a top priority to prevent these discharges.

There’s no doubt the rising cost of healthcare caused by Obamacare has burdened American families and created a massive increase in bureaucracy resulting in less choice. In fact, Martin and St. Lucie counties now have only one provider on the individual exchange.

Following retirement from the Army, I continued my work in counter terrorism and national defense as an Explosive Specialist under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). I also carried forward in life the standard that whatever cause I believe in, I will not just support in word, but will support with the work of my hands. For this reason, in 2015, I volunteered to serve alongside the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to show support for the freedom Israel represents throughout the Middle East and the world.

Working under JSOC meant fighting at the tip of the spear in the ongoing war against radical Islamic terrorism. Being a bomb technician in this high level of special operations came with a great responsibility. My task was protecting my fellow soldiers from the war’s most deadly weapon, the improvised explosive device (IED). This meant placing myself directly in the line of fire on each and every mission.

Serving my country is all I ever really wanted to do. It runs in my blood from my father to my uncles. My wife Brianna and I pray that one day our children will find the same passion.

My parents, James Mast & Timoxena Trujillo, always instilled in me a strong work ethic and a deeply rooted patriotism. They showed me how long held American values have made our country great and can bring success in every endeavor I have the courage to undertake.

PAID FOR BY MAST FOR CONGRESS

I believe in my heart that the trials we each face have little importance compared to what we do in response to each challenge that we face. We as Americans do not curl up into a corner and quit when life gets tough. We own our challenges. We use those challenges as the tool to make us the strongest we have ever been. I believe it is that kind of people we must never cease to be.

After graduating from South Christian High School in 1999, I followed in my father’s footsteps and enlisted in the U.S. Army. There I enjoyed service for over 12 years. However, as much as I loved being a soldier, I always knew pleasure was never its intent. During my service, I had the honor of serving under the elite Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) as a bomb disposal expert. This meant that life was always dangerous and very often deadly.

As a result, when I awoke after injury in Walter Reed Army Medical Center my focus was singular: get better, get back to work, and get back to serving America. I decided I was not going to let the best defense I have given our country be in my past. Each day thereafter consisted of 8 grueling hours of physical therapy. In addition to recovery and my ongoing military duties, I would also provide my requested expertise to the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco & Firearms (ATF).

While I was able to detect and destroy most of these IED’s, the very last IED I found resulted in sustained catastrophic injuries, which included the loss of both my legs. During this time in service I was awarded medals for valor, merit, and sacrifice, to include The Bronze Star Medal,The Army Commendation Medal for Valor, The Purple Heart Medal, and The Defense Meritorious Service Medal.

I was proud to pledge my life in defense of our country. That is a commitment which will always live inside of me. I am humbled and honored to fight for you as your Congressman from Florida’s 18th congressional district. I strive to serve you in Congress as I did on the battlefield: without regard for personal gain or personal sacrifice.
