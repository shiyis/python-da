Margaret has created hundreds of jobs as a business owner and attained advanced degrees, all while raising her family as a mother of 4 children - she will bring that strong work ethic to Washington.

I do what I say, and I say what I mean.

Margaret is willing to work across the aisle on any good ideas that will benefit the hardworking people of Connecticut and not be deterred by partisan politics.

I can't win this race without your help. And I hope you will give me the chance to earn your confidence.

CONNECTICUT, WE DESERVE IT

PO Box 10, Milford, CT 06460

I WILL DO BETTER FOR CONNECTICUT.

"I'm willing to work with anyone that wants to solve problems and achieve positive results regardless of party or politics. I know we can fix healthcare to make it more affordable and accessible, protect our seniors’ rights and benefits, lower our heavy tax burdens and create a stronger local economy with well-paying jobs. Join me and let's get it done."

As a single mother and business owner, Margaret solves problems on a daily basis and will do the same as your next Congresswoman.

While having four children, I built businesses, created jobs, and tackled the tough issues that come with running a mid-sized business. I have negotiated, managed and lead through highly complex situations, in both regulatory and open-market economies, and I've spent my career improving lives and the homes in which people live.
