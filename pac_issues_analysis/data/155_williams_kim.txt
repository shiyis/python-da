For too long, we have bought into the idea that our safety depends on high incarceration rates. We’ve spent billions stacking the deck against the poor and communities of color in order to support an entire industry that profits from mass incarceration. As a result, we imprison more people than any other country on earth.

And we are no safer for it. It’s time to redesign our criminal justice systems to be effective, fair, and humane for the entire population.This will require investments in rehabilitation, mental health care, and providing reintegration opportunities that are less destructive and more cost-effective. We must also reexamine the failed War on Drugs, eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, get rid of cash bail, and implement training to reduce racial bias.

Copyright © 2020 Kim for Congress. All Rights Reserved. Paid for by Kim for Congress.

The United States operates separate criminal justice systems for the wealthy and the poor, and we must address these disparities by ensuing equal justice, which requires a new commitment to prosecuting giant corporations – and their leaders – when they cheat customers, stomp out their competitors, or rob their workers.

“We need real reform that addresses the root causes of migration, and provides an achievable path to status and citizenship so that our neighbors don’t have to live in fear.”

We must also address the root causes that drive individuals from their homes and take concrete steps to combat the violence, climate change, and injustice that has displaced millions.

CA-16 is a diverse community, and every member of our community deserves respect, equality, and safety. I am committed to combating systemic racism and bias by lifting up marginalized communities and expanding equal opportunity for all. We must overturn this Administration’s policy of cruelty and division by ending private detention facilities that create inhumane conditions and separate families at our border. I am committed to work towards a clear path for citizenship for all undocumented immigrants.

California’s 16th Congressional District has some of the highest poverty rates in the country, and incomes are stagnant. This is unacceptable. The federal government can and should make investments in our communities to address the housing shortage, bring down rents, and create new jobs in this district.

We must also make quality education a higher priority if we are going to provide opportunities for good jobs, stronger families and more resilient communities. We know what needs to be done to refocus education to prepare our kids for the future because teachers have been telling us, and I’m listening. We have to invest in K12 public schools and ensure all our teachers earn a living wage. It means maintaining small class sizes, de-emphasizing high-stakes tests, and providing resources that support teachers and encourage STEM skills for the 21st-century economy.

Wage distribution, particularly in our agriculture industry, is top heavy, enriching corporations and business owners while employees experience poverty and food insecurity. We can make investments that create economic opportunity while addressing rural neglect and a legacy of racial discrimination.

“We deserve a government that uses taxpayer money to benefit the lives of everyday working people and prioritizes us over the profits of corporations and wealthy individuals.”

The American people deserve representatives who will fight for the dignity, health, and prosperity of their constituents—and that starts with holding our leaders accountable. We must also enact automatic voter registration for every 18 year-old citizen, expand access to online registration and early voting, and make Election Day a federal holiday. We must also impose term limits on the House and Senate in order to bring new voices to Congress and make publicly funded elections a reality.

It’s time to get the corruption of big money out of Washington to ensure legislation isn’t written by the highest bidder. Industry lobbyists, corporations, and wealthy individuals spend billions every year to influence Congress and federal agencies to put corporate interests above all else. Closing loopholes on lobbying and overturning Citizens United will help to get big, unaccountable, foreign, and secret money out of politics.

#5: Fresno-Madera, CA The Fresno-Madera metro area in California ranked 5th out of 187 metropolitan areas for yearly particle pollution. It also ranked very high in the other categories, coming in 3rd for 24-hour particle pollution and 4rd for high ozone days.

The Green New Deal also puts people at the center of the plan to transition to a sustainable and equitable world. It provides Americans with the training, education, and job guarantees needed to ensure a feasible and just transition, especially for those communities that are the least responsible for climate change and the most affected by it: working class families, low-income workers, people of color, and indigenous peoples.

#6: Modesto-Merced, CA The Modesto-Merced area in California’s Central Valley had poor air quality by all measures in the American Lung Association report. It ranked 6th for annual particle pollution, 5th for 24-hour particle pollution and 7th for high ozone days.

#2: Visalia-Porterville-Hanford, CA Coming in second on the list was the Visalia-Porterville-Hanford metro area in California’s San Joaquin Valley. It’s a bit of an improvement over 2017’s #1 worst ranking. It also ranked 2nd for 24-hour particle pollution and 3rd for high ozone days.

The Green New Deal is a fast and necessary transition to 100% renewable energy for everyone. We need to eliminate fossil fuel use everywhere, and we need to cut off the social licensing and financing of fossil fuel companies. We must divest, desponsor, and defund these companies and finally put an end to this industry’s legal immunity.

#3: Bakersfield, CA Bakersfield has some unhealthy air. Beyond being ranked third for yearly particle pollution, it ranked worst for 24-hour particle pollution and 2nd for high ozone days.

The majority of Americans want Medicare for All, but many of our representatives have yet to sign on to this plan. As insurance costs pile up and our district faces greater health hazards than ever before, the current system must be replaced. It’s time to prioritize constituent needs over corporate interests and ensure every individual in this valley has the healthcare they deserve.

“Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. It’s time to pass Medicare for All.”

Americans spend twice as much per person on healthcare than people in any other industrialized nation on Earth. And while benefits have remained largely unchanged over the last 30 years, California’s family coverage premiums have increased by 248.8%. This high cost has not improved the quality of our healthcare or increased access. In our district, 62,000 individuals have no coverage at all.

Medicare for All will ensure all our hard working families have access to the care they need regardless of their employer. This will eliminate excess costs, reduce out-of-pocket expenses, and put an average of $3,000 back into the pockets of Valley residents each year. It is time to expand coverage to include dental and mental healthcare, end medical bankruptcies, and create a system where healthcare is a guaranteed right, not a privilege.

Kim joined the Foreign Service as a diplomat with the U.S. State Department. During her tenure, she served as a press and cultural attaché, a Special Assistant to the Acting Assistant Secretary, and she developed hundreds of educational programs. She also led efforts in the Department to expand diversity recruitment and worked on policy development with the UN’s Office on Drugs and Crime.

It’s time to elect a leader who will advance the safety, security, and economic prosperity of all the good people who call the San Joaquin Valley home. The urgency of issues – and the real opportunities for solutions – have my focus.

The deadline to register or re-register to vote for any election is 11:59:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the 15th calendar day before that election. If you are 16 or 17 years old, you can pre-register to vote.

What I Will Focus on While Representing California’s 16th Congressional District

Copyright © 2020 Kim for Congress. All Rights Reserved. Paid for by Kim for Congress.

I didn’t come from money, but I grew up at a point in time where you didn’t have to. I was able to work hard, pay my way through school, and build my American dream. I want to create the same paths to opportunity for everyone in California’s 16th congressional district.

Kim carried her management experience from the Foreign Service to Mariposa County where she has dedicated her efforts to improving the lives of working parents. In both roles she championed efforts to establish flexible work spaces, create remote opportunities for employees in rural areas, and diversify work forces.

Kim led her college’s efforts to develop and expand online courses opening up access to a college degree for many non-traditional students in her community. Kim helped her students see themselves in America’s history and future, and she not only showed her students where new immigrants fit into America’s story, she required them to engage their elected officials and raise their voices for themselves and their community.

At every step of her career, Kim has been an agent of change, and she has built bridges between people and opportunity. She understands the difficult challenges working families face today and is committed to bold solutions that dismantle income inequality, combat poverty, and hand political power back to the American voter.

The California Primaries Are March 3, 2020. Polls Open At 7 Am. Are You Registered To Vote?

Kim is the product of a small community and a working class family. As a young woman, she worked multiple jobs while earning her degree. She then went on to graduate school and began her career as a tenured faculty member. She taught U.S. history to thousands of diverse, international students, many of whom were the first in their families to go to college. Like her, they worked several part-time jobs to support themselves, pay tuition, and pursue their American dream. Kim spent many long hours helping students work through challenges — including one unforgettable grandmother who cleaned homes and offices until 2:00 a.m., and still succeeded. She is a proud single working mother to her daughter, Cassi, who is Ethiopian by birth. Cassi came of age as the daughter of a diplomat and represented America, by her mom’s side, since she was two. Cassi is also the first person in her family to run for office, winning her race for Treasurer in third grade.
