Mike Thompson for Congress PO Box 10541 Napa, CA 94581

“My number one priority as your member of Congress is growing our economy, creating good jobs and strengthening our middle class. That’s why I’m fighting for job creating investments in infrastructure, energy and education that will put people to work now, and put our economy on solid ground for years to come. If we make these investments, our district and our country will be better off – it will be a place where our middle class is strong and secure, where hard work is rewarded, where everybody gets a fair shot, and everyone has the opportunity to succeed.”

IMMIGRATION

 <tag> p


Immigration reform is a priority of mine and I can assure you I will work with my colleagues in the House of Representative to bring effective and meaningful change to this issue.

Mike Thompson for Congress PO Box 10541 Napa, CA 94581

Authorized & Paid For By Mike Thompson For Congress

During my time in Congress, I have supported many immigration reform proposals that would increase immigration enforcement policies, while also supporting policies that would help immigrants who are suffering due to our broken system. Most recently I introduced a bill that would help military and veteran families more easily gain citizenship. I also support bills that would give immigrant children access to education benefits, create workable guest worker programs for our agricultural workers and eliminate discrimination of same-sex couples from gaining immigration status for their partners.

“America is a nation of immigrants, and we are a stronger nation because of it. However, our current immigration system is broken and in need of repair. We need comprehensive reform that that rewards individuals who play by the rules, allows children of immigrants to get a college education, provides a pathway to citizenship for families who have been here for generations, and establishes a guest worker program for those here doing jobs Americans don’t want to do.”

I am a third generation Italian-American on my mother’s side, whose great grand-parents immigrated from Italy to America. Today, as they have been since our nation was founded, immigrants are an essential part of our society and culture. Leaders in both business and government are helping make our nation better every day. I have no doubt our nation would be weaker without the diversity of our immigrant population.

Unfortunately, our current immigration system is broken and we need comprehensive immigration reform. I believe we need immigration policies that are fair and practical, rewarding individuals who play by the rules and punishing those who break the law.

BDCP

 <tag> p


The state of California and the federal government have teamed up with water users from south of the Delta to implement a Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP). The BDCP aims to ensure reliable water supplies to communities and farmers in Central and Southern California by taking water from Northern California. I am deeply concerned that the needs of our Delta communities will be cast aside in order to get as much water as possible to south-of-Delta water users. This is not acceptable. It is neither necessary nor wise to create a large new water facility to pull water from our precious Delta ecosystem. We need inclusive, transparent, science-based solutions to solve our water challenges. As we move forward, I will work to make sure those are the solutions we see.

Mike Thompson for Congress PO Box 10541 Napa, CA 94581

“The Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) creates a flawed process for moving forward to address our water challenges. It is not based on science and puts the interests of South-of-Delta water contractors before our farmers, fishermen and local communities. We cannot allow this deal to move forward. Many of our families and small businesses that depend on the Delta would have their livelihood stripped away and the Delta’s diverse wildlife would be destroyed. We need a plan that is transparent and based on sound science so that our Delta communities, businesses, fish, wildlife and environment are not harmed. I will keep fighting for a fair BDCP that protects our communities.” The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is one of our region’s most precious resources. The Delta, spanning Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, and Yolo counties in Northern California at the confluence of these two rivers, and the nearby San Francisco Bay together form a natural treasure that is vital to our region. The Bay-Delta provides critical habitat to a multitude of fish and wildlife, and many of our Delta communities have businesses that depend on a healthy Delta to thrive.

“As a hunter and gun owner, I believe that we should protect the Second Amendment right of law-abiding individuals to own firearms. As a dad and grandfather, I also believe that we have a responsibility to make our schools, streets and communities safe. We can do both by passing commonsense policies like comprehensive criminal background checks.”

“My number one priority as your member of Congress is growing our economy, creating good jobs and strengthening our middle class. That’s why I’m fighting for job creating investments in infrastructure, energy and education that will put people to work now, and put our economy on solid ground for years to come. If we make these investments, our district and our country will be better off – it will be a place where our middle class is strong and secure, where hard work is rewarded, where everybody gets a fair shot, and everyone has the opportunity to succeed.”

“America is a nation of immigrants, and we are a stronger nation because of it. However, our current immigration system is broken and in need of repair. We need comprehensive reform that that rewards individuals who play by the rules, allows children of immigrants to get a college education, provides a pathway to citizenship for families who have been here for generations, and establishes a guest worker program for those here doing jobs Americans don’t want to do.”

Seniors “Social Security and Medicare are two of the most important and successful government programs ever created. Each year, they reliably pay billions in benefits to millions of beneficiaries and deliver on our promise of protecting seniors who worked hard all their lives. Not only are they important for our seniors’ economic and health security, they are important to our economy. We must make sure the promise of Social Security and Medicare is 100 percent certain for generations to come.” Read More
