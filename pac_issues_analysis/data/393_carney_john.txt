JOHN’S RECORD AS GOVERNOR

John Carney has been working to make Delaware a better place for more than 30 years.

GET A YARD SIGN

 <tag> p


From 2011 to 2017, John served as Delaware’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives. During his three terms in Congress, John worked with members of both parties to find solutions to the most important challenges facing the nation. He supported the revitalization of American manufacturing through the “Make It In America” agenda. He was a lead sponsor of the centerpiece of the Jumpstart our Businesses (JOBS) Act that made it easier for small- and medium-sized businesses to grow and create jobs. John also introduced legislation that was signed into law to prevent critical prescription drug shortages, and he was the lead sponsor on a successful bill to help veterans more easily enter the job market.



Prior to his time in Congress, John served two terms as Delaware’s Lt. Governor. Between 2001 and 2009, John developed the Lt. Governor’s Challenge to encourage Delawareans to live active, healthier lifestyles. He also created and implemented the Models of Excellence in Education program that allowed schools throughout the state to share best practices. In addition, John was a strong supporter of the Delaware smoking ban and he led the fight for a Cancer Right to Know law, ultimately passed in 2008. John also served as Chairman of the Delaware Healthcare Commission, the Criminal Justice Council, and the Delaware Science & Technology Council.

John currently lives in Wilmington with his wife Tracey. They have two sons, Sam and Jimmy.

Under then-Governor Tom Carper, John served as Delaware’s Secretary of Finance and Deputy Chief of Staff. Before that, he was Deputy Chief Administrative Officer for New Castle County, and on the staff of then-Senator Joe Biden. In these roles, he helped Delaware earn its first ever AAA bond rating, played a key role in the state’s purchase of the Port of Wilmington, and worked to cut taxes nine times.

Born in Wilmington and raised in Claymont, Governor John Carney has been working for the Delaware people for more than 30 years. John took office as Delaware’s 74th Governor in January 2017, focused on making Delaware’s economy more competitive, preparing Delaware’s children to succeed, and building a long-term sustainable financial plan for the State of Delaware. Working with Delawareans across the state, and with members of the General Assembly, he has made progress on each of those priorities. John has directed new resources to high-needs schools, partnered with the private sector to drive new job creation, and taken steps to lower healthcare costs for Delaware families, businesses, and taxpayers.

The second of nine children, John was born in Wilmington and raised in Claymont by his parents, Jack and Ann Carney, who were both educators. He attended St. Mark’s High School and led the school’s football team to its first state championship in 1973. After graduating high school, John attended Dartmouth College where he continued his football career and earned All-Ivy League and Most Valuable Player honors. When John returned to Delaware, he coached Freshmen Football on the staff of UD Head Coach Tubby Raymond while earning a Master’s Degree in Public Administration at the University of Delaware.

Over these last four years, one of the best parts of serving as your Governor has been hosting town hall meetings with members of the General Assembly in communities across Delaware. We’ve brought Delawareans together from Claymont to Delmar – and most places in between – to discuss and debate the issues facing our state.

Op-ed by Governor John Carney

I have spent much of the last several months talking directly to Delawareans about the challenges we face, listening, and attempting to chart a productive path forward, even if we sometimes disagree.

 <tag> p




Over the next four years, we’ll also continue the hard work of strengthening our public schools for all Delaware children. We’ll build on the largest infrastructure program in Delaware history, fixing roads and bridges and creating good jobs up and down our state. We’ll continue fighting to clean up our waterways and protect Delaware’s beautiful natural environment. And we’ll do it responsibly — protecting taxpayer dollars and making sure we have a sustainable budget that invests in our future.

On issues of racial justice, we haven’t waited to take action. We have already taken steps administratively and with our partners in the General Assembly to move forward productively. That work will continue. The legacy of Congressman John Lewis should motivate all of us to make real progress.

That’s why I’m proud to officially announce that I will be seeking a second term as your Governor this fall. I’m confident that Delaware will step up, ignore the voices that would divide us, and come out of 2020 stronger because we worked together. I also look forward to electing Delaware’s own Joe Biden our next president. I know Joe – and I believe his compassion, his leadership and his unrelenting advocacy for working families are uniquely suited for this time.

Amidst the pandemic, on May 25, Delawareans joined the chorus of voices across the U.S. demanding racial justice after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. George Floyd’s killing exposed deep wounds around race in Delaware — as it has across our country.

Here’s what I know: Delawareans don’t always agree. But they’ll tell you what they think. And they’ll hear you out. As long as you’re willing to listen.

I have spent much of the last several months talking directly to Delawareans about the challenges we face, listening, and attempting to chart a productive path forward, even if we sometimes disagree.

Most of all, I will commit to listening. To hearing the concerns of all Delawareans and working together productively, in good faith. It’s true that we can only get through this by working together.

To state the obvious, 2020 has been an unusual and challenging year for our state and country. Most of our town hall meetings have been canceled by the COVID-19 pandemic. And, frankly, I haven’t thought much about campaign politics.

Since early this year in Delaware, we’ve been focused first and foremost on protecting lives, protecting the livelihoods of Delaware families, and confronting the threat of COVID-19.

John Carney is Delaware’s 74th Governor, and is seeking a second term on November 3.

It has been a privilege to serve as your Governor. Let’s commit to making real progress for another four years.

Since Day 1, we’ve relied on the science in response to COVID-19. Delawareans and Delaware businesses have made considerable sacrifices, and have taken basic precautions to keep their family, friends and neighbors healthy.

But despite the challenges, I believe this is a time of great potential. There’s never been a better time to get involved in our democratic process, to have your voice heard, and help shape the future of Delaware and our country. As difficult as this year has been, we’ve seen that it’s possible in 2020 to make meaningful change.
