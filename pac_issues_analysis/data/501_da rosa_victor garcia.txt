Victor brings decades of cross-industrial leadership experience to his political pursuits. Through dealing with various business entities, Victor has learned how to not only maximize financial profits and create economic growth, but also how to serve as a peacemaker- bridging gaps, aligning interests, and unifying diverse groups.

He seeks to create legislation for better veteran opportunities for the many who have served so bravely and return to their homes without opportunity for their much deserved futures. He is also pro-life, pro-Israel, pro-free speech, pro-term-limits, fiscally responsible, and excited to represent the true conservative voice.

As a Republican Candidate for the United States House of Representatives in 2022, Victor Garcia da Rosa promises to put into practice the empowering words uttered by his father and speak for the underdog so they too can "work hard, rest hard, play hard" on their individual quests for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in the finest nation in the world. His desire to serve Florida's 21st Congressional District is born out of a deep-rooted conviction, "....when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."

A member of the House of Representatives should look just like you and me: everyday hard working Americans looking to make a difference in their communities. White collar, blue collar, university degrees, or perhaps a humble degree earned through many years of trial and error that only the experiences of life can bestow.

A member of the House of Representatives should have two ears to listen, yet possess one bold, unabashed voice to make the will of their constituents known in Washington D.C.
