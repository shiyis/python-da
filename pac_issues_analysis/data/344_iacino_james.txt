In many ways, my family’s story is the American Dream—the hope and promise this country offers. Come here. Work hard. Contribute. Your hard work will pay off for you and for your family.

PO Box 26

James Iacino, Progressive Democrat for Colorado's 3rd District

When I got my start working on loading docks and driving trucks, I learned that upward mobility for workers is key to the success of the whole community and that protecting our natural resources is good for everyone.

Since taking over the company, I’ve implemented industry-leading sustainability practices that I know my grandfather would be proud of. I’ve also made sure that our workers have the opportunity to learn new skills, advance their careers, and earn a middle-class wage.

But politicians in Washington are holding Coloradans back. They’re playing partisan games and looking out for their own self-interest instead of fighting for hardworking families back home. We need new leaders who have experience fighting for economic opportunity and we need those leaders representing Coloradans in DC.

My grandfather was just sixteen when he began to pursue the American Dream. He started selling fish and oysters to local restaurants and markets from a small pushcart. That business took root, grew, and 101 years later, I lead that same business and now employ 200 workers across Colorado.

But for too many Colorado families today, the American Dream is out of reach.

Montrose, CO 81401

Together, we have the ability to spread this promise throughout Colorado.

And that's why I am running to represent Colorado’s 3rd District in Congress.

"I have had several conversations with James Iacino since the beginning of his candidacy, and here’s my conclusion:

Former Archuleta County Commissioner

Pagosa Springs

La Plata County Commissoner

"I'm proud to endorse James Iacino, Democrat for Congress in Colorado’s 3rd district. A proven leader on sustainability, James also has the track record and solid business experience to help build an economy that works for everyone,” said Fmr. State Senator Gail Schwartz. “Having worked his way from the loading docks to running one of Colorado’s most successful businesses, we can trust James to look out for the hardworking families of Western and Southern Colorado. It is time for a strong voice in Washington who will stand up for the values of rural Colorado. I know James Iacino, and he has what it takes to beat Scott Tipton in 2020.”

"I am happy to endorse James Iacino in the 3rd Congressional District Primary. Like myself, James comes from a family of immigrants who came to the United States to find a new home and build a better life. He has lived up to his grandparent's legacy and helped to build a better life for many hardworking Coloradans. Most importantly, James has shown up to our communities and understands how to listen. Whether we were crossing paths on the trail in Leadville or Glenwood Springs, it was clear that James has the best interest of every Coloradan at heart."

Former Mayor of Durango

“I am happy to support James Iacino for Colorado’s 3rd District. We need a champion to take on Scott Tipton. James Iacino understands the importance of protecting our environment and he will work for all of us in the 3rd, not just the few.”

James Iacino has a long Colorado history with solid executive experience from scaling up his family business, Seattle Fish Company, into a statewide distribution network for Colorado products, not just fish! He has strong ties to the farmers and ranchers he works with, and like a 3d generation Coloradan he is progress-oriented and practical with his honest consideration of input from everyday people.

Auden Schendler

James Iacino has what it takes to beat Scott Tipton and lead Colorado out of the crisis. I am proud to stand with James Iacino in the CD3 primary, and to work with him to build an economy that works for every Coloradan.”

Sweetie Marbury

Ed Brown

Pueblo City Council President

Montrose, CO 81401

Kathleen Sullivan-Kelley

"I am glad to stand with James Iacino in the 3rd district Democratic Primary. Pueblo has a strong history in labor and standing for working Coloradans. James' proven ability to build and expand a family business while championing good pay and benefits shows that he is the candidate to stand for hardworking Coloradans here in Pueblo and throughout CD3."

Greg Poschman, Pitkin County Commissioner & Lifetime Colorado Resident, like James Iacino:

Former Mayor of Montrose

“I support James Iacino because it is high time we elected a person with the courage to stand for the good of the whole, instead of the profit for a few. Solutions for our current crisis in our food supply chain depend on leaders like James.”

“I’ve served communities throughout Colorado for years in the state legislature and as our Lieutenant Governor and understand the diverse issues facing us. I have come to know James and sincerely believe he has the right combination of compassion, toughness, and experience to represent us here in the 3rd District and not be a lap dog for the special interests in Washington. James knows the value of supporting and distributing local Colorado products, including many from our farms, ranches, and businesses, and he knows the impact that increasing their footprint can have in our communities.

Dan Baer

“I am proud to endorse James Iacino to represent the 3rd Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. My family is rooted in the life and history of the San Luis Valley and the farming and ranching heritage of our place. In the same way, James and his family have been in Colorado for over a hundred years including a major presence in Montrose. James will be a champion for us in addressing the economic, health care, and educational challenges in our rural congressional district. And he will be a champion for our beautiful public lands. It is time we take back the 3rd, and James Iacino is the person that will do it. I am proud to be on his team.”

- Former Congressman for Colorado's 3rd Congressional District

"I've worked my entire life to make my home, the San Luis Valley, and the rest of Colorado a better place, and was privileged to represent the 3rd District for six years in Washington D.C. I am happy to stand with James Iacino in his run for Congress. A strong Democrat, he has the experience needed to beat Scott Tipton and bring a real voice back to the people of Western and Southern Colorado,” said former Congressman John Salazar. “Partisan special interests have left us behind and James' record building strong working relationships and bringing people to the table is what we need to make sure our communities are thriving into the future."

Walsenburg

Dan Richardson

John Egan

Aspen City Councilman

James Iacino is well-aware of the importance of environmental and landscape protections to all our citizens, and to our substantial tourism and agriculture industries. James Iacino can stand up to the Feds, like we would expect from a real Colorado Congressman. I think he would be a big improvement on the incumbent, and I think he can win!”

Our nation is in an unprecedented time of crisis, and every one of us needs to do everything within our power to help fight the spread of COVID-19. Sheltering at home, continued social distancing and perseverance are some of the small things we can do as individuals, but our government must be able to stand up and respond in our time of need, we need a representative who will lead in a time of crisis.

PO Box 26

We need to make sure that our teachers and schools have access to the funding they need to ensure that they and our students are able to thrive. Where you live should not impact your ability to access a good education for your family.

We are in the midst of a climate crisis and need to do everything we can to protect our environment and reverse the impact of decades of increasing pollution. Caring for our environment and protecting our wildlands and waters are critical to our Colorado way of life. I have been a leader on sustainability in Colorado for a decade and know the impact we can make if we invest in clean energy and restorative practices.

102 years ago, my grandfather founded our family’s business and grew it from a small pushcart in downtown Denver to a leading food distribution company, achieving his American Dream. We need to build an economy that works for everyone, not just the few at the top. Every Coloradan deserves the ability to earn a decent wage, to work for a better life for themselves and their family, and to achieve their American Dream.

We need to be committed to protecting and advancing the liberties and rights that are given to us in the Constitution. Reforming our immigration system, protecting voting rights and ensuring equal protection for everyone regardless of race or gender must be priorities of our next Congress.

We need to take care of those who have fought for our country and our freedom. Our veterans deserve access to the healthcare and the benefits they need. We also need programs to give veterans the job training and placement they need. They served our country, and now it is our time to serve them.

Montrose, CO 81401

Having access to quality, affordable health care is a right, not a privilege and we must fight to ensure that everyone has access to the coverage they need. Millions of Americans still lack the critical care they need to survive, I will work to build off what was started with Obamacare to ensure that everyone has access to the care they deserve.
