THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER ELECTION.

There is so much at stake during the 2020 election. Radical left wing liberals are trying to undermine our duly elected President. We must send bold conservatives to Washington who are willing to fight back.

ON THE ISSUES

I am not a politician and I have never run for office. I am a conservative outsider taking on a class of career politicians and political hacks who want business as usual.

SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT

DRAIN THE SWAMP

Our founding fathers established a guidebook meant to create a nation, under God, where life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are the rights of every citizen. I will defend our 2nd Amendment rights, as well as every other right that is under attack by the liberal left.

Spineless “Never Trumpers” have allowed Democrats the ability to embark on a never-ending witch hunt designed to destroy our duly-elected President. I will fully support President Trump and his America First agenda.

FIX OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

BUILD THE WALL

11216 North Tamiami Trail Suite 542 Naples, FL 34110

Illegal Immigration threatens us all. The drugs, human trafficking, and overall lawlessness that comes with open borders must stop. The cost in both dollars and lives is a national tragedy.

CONTINUE THE FIGHT FOR CLEAN WATER

ON THE TRAIL

I am a Doctor, not a politician, and the sickest thing on Earth is the federal government. Career politicians have committed legislative malpractice through reckless spending and have burdened our children with insurmountable debt and nanny state government. It's time to limit the scope of government, shrink our debt, and return power to the citizens.

As a physician, I have served thousands of Southwest Florida patients. I have seen firsthand how government-controlled healthcare drives up costs and destroys patients' quality of care. I will fight for a free market system that ensures competitive prices and quality of service.

Career politicians on both sides of the aisle have driven our nation’s finances into a monumental pit of debt. Undoubtedly, the single greatest threat to our security and future, I will run at our problems head on. I will make the difficult, but necessary decisions to get our country back on track.

Tourism is the livelihood and backbone of our Southwest Florida economy. I will stand up to special interest who are destroying our waterfront sanctuaries. I will work with the private sector to continue the development of innovative solutions to protect our environment.

CUT WASTEFUL SPENDING

Life begins at conception, and we must defend the rights and lives of those who cannot defend themselves. I will fight to defund Planned Parenthood and stop their promotion of senseless murder against the unborn.
