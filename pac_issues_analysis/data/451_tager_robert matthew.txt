Gus Bilirakis has been in Congress since 2006 when he took his fathers congressional seat. Based upon his votes and support for legislation that harms Social Security, Medicare, VA, against fighting climate change, against job stimulants, economic recovery, middle class, it is time for a new and different Voice. The following are his votes. Some of my positions are laid out immediately after his harmful voting

My positions are very simple and crafted through common sense:

Therefore if a single parent worked 40 hrs per week at current minimum wage, they would earn only $700 more than federal poverty level at the end of the year!! OR : $13.46 weekly!! Most of us are only one unexpected major expense away from financial catastrophe.

Our current congressman, Gus, is not for us. He has never voted for our benefit. He has consistently voted against our interests and in favor of those special interest groups that support him through millions of dollars of campaign contributions. Our District, State, and Nation needs a representative that fights to better the majority of the people and not the few elites. We need representation that puts the good of the people and Country first. I am that person. I will fight for all of the people and not corporations or special interests.

It’s not fair that only those at the top, non-profit corporations and other big business entities enjoy tax advantages.

It is disgusting and unacceptable that after decades of promises by disconnected politicians, the Veterans Affairs is still not giving our veterans the care they deserve.

Increasing Minimum Wage

I support pay equality for women. With that being said, I have to ask how are we still dealing with this issue?

RIGHT TO VOTE

I vehemently oppose any attempt to privatize any part of social security and/or Medicare.

It is not only unfair, but also unjust to deny people who have served their debt to society to be forever stripped of their right to vote.

Job creation and job growth should begin and end right here at home – not halfway around the globe.

It is a sad testament to our current leadership that many people who work 40 hours or more a week are still living below the poverty line.

 <tag> p




The reversal of these types of policies that deny democracy will be one of my top priorities once I am elected.

Medicare for all or the Public Option.

I urge business to take a hard look on this social problem. If you have a suggestion on how to screen and enforce equal pay for equal rights please send me an email. Together, we can arrive at a workable solution.

The same policies should apply to our retired and honorably discharged soldiers that are filing new claims.

Our veterans have special needs that the private sector is unable to handle. Additionally, our service men and women deserve better than being thrown to the mercy of insurance companies by just handing them a voucher. It is an absurd alternative.

I have many more tax “adjustments” in mind and will post them soon. These are not difficult or unique ideas or solutions. They would help everyone bring the ends they’re trying to meet a little closer together.

If abortions are outlawed, who will be punished? Will it be the Doctor that performs the procedure or the women that gets it? How will we treat the women that want an abortion, for what ever reason, and they ingest chemicals or use a coat hanger to attempt an abortion themselves? (Our pre Roe history shows this was not uncommon). If abortions are outlawed, will women be responsible for the outcome of the pregnancy? Will she be charged with a crime if the pregnancy ends in a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion? Will she be accused and charged with the crime of performing her own abortion if she naturally miscarries? What if the birth produces a child with birth defects, will the women be charged with not having proper prenatal care or not taking extra precautions to protect the pregnancy? Will the doctor be charged with not properly caring for the pregnancy if it naturally aborts or has birth defects? Will we go back to the days when women did not go for prenatal care because they were afraid of being prosecuted for having an unhealthy lifestyle? There is no end to the potential consequences.

As your Congressman, I will work diligently to see that we all see relief on April 15th. Here’s how:

If trade with China was a good strategy to bring about democratic reforms in China, the same logic should equally apply to the island 90 miles off our southern shore, Cuba.

There are different strategies for creating jobs and job growth. These are some of the strategies I will fight for in an effort to bring federal money to areas within our district.

The idea that the workers who make profits for the companies are paid below a rate that they can live on comfortably is outrageous. It reminds me of this old adage: The rich have all the money, the middle class do all the work, and the poor are there to scare the hell out of the middle class to keep them working.

There is no excuse for OUR failure to take care of our veterans as we promised them, and I will fight to show that our slogan, “we support our troops,” is more than merely lip service.

I oppose right to work laws.

It is not only unfair, but also unjust to deny people who have served their debt to society to be forever stripped of their right to vote.

Many politicians argue increasing competition and allowing insurance companies to sell insurance across state lines would reduce insurance costs. This is nonsense. Here are a few of the insurance companies in Florida selling health insurance; Aetna, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Humana, Humana One, Cigna, United Healthcare, Coventry, Celtic, and Health First. These nine are only a part of the health insurance companies offering insurance in Florida. It is hard to see what difference the 10th large insurance carrier to the market will make in the price of coverage.

It is pathetic that we have to fight for a minimum wage increase. After years of huge profits and a skyrocketing stock market, there is more than enough money to pay employees double the current unrealistic minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. That amounts to a gross income of $1,160 a month and $13,920 a year, before taxes are withdrawn, leaving families with even less to survive on.

Once I am elected, I will work to remove marijuana as a schedule one drug. I will also work to permit the VA to prescribe marijuana in treating pain and PTSD in our Veterans. They deserve the alternative to the highly addictive and life ending opiates.

Single payer, or as Senator Sanders calls it, “Medicare for all” is rationale, intelligent, and will work. This is something we can and must do.

The conservative agenda is hypocritical. They preach that they want medical care to be between a patient and their doctor and for the government to stay out of it. At the same time they advocate for, and legislate obstacles to obtain legal procedures. Many states have enacted roadblocks to abortions. These roadblocks include laws that require a women to have an ultrasound before an abortion and in many of these instances, a transvaginal ultrasound is required. (Transvaginal means “through the vagina” wherein a probe is inserted into the women for as long as 60 minutes). Where is the, “Keep the government out of our medical decisions” outrage from the conservative leadership. In the 2015/2016 congressional session, a bill was introduced to require all women in the Country to undergo these examinations before an abortion can be obtained. This bill is still pending.

Locally, Infrastructure jobs would include fixing the flooding problem due to neglect of ditches and drainage systems, and expanding capacity on our roadways to end gridlock.

This must change.

It’s not fair that only those at the top, non-profit corporations and other big business entities enjoy tax advantages.

It is disgusting and unacceptable that after decades of promises by disconnected politicians, the Veterans Affairs is still not giving our veterans the care they deserve.

1) One of the most important areas for job growth is in strengthening our educational base. Not everyone wants to go to college and there must be an alternative to McDonalds and Walmart for these people. I envision public education at the high school level have a trade school program, working in connection with Unions, to both train our kids and provide apprenticeship programs and then job placement. Service industry, nursing, carpentry, iron workers, pipe fitters, truckers are all good paying jobs are some examples.

Although I have advocated medical expenses be deductible to provide financial relief, I will diligently pursue a single payer system, or “Medicare for all” as Senator Sanders refers to it. Healthcare is a human right and the determination of how a patient is treated should not be based on monetary policy, or pursuit of corporate profit or personal fortune.

Paid for by the Committee to Elect Tager for Congress

As a Representative for the 12th Congressional District, I will fight to change the IRS code to make the owners of these non-profit health care providers public record. I will also work to end the loophole that allows profits of $658 million to be untaxed, allowing the non-profit companies to buy their competitors, eliminating competition. Is it any wonder the top half of one percent is getting richer by the day?

It is past time for the minimum wage to be increased to one that people can actually live on. I will fight for a minimum wage of $15.00 an hour for hourly employees. I also support an increase of the minimum wage for service staff earning tips. These increases will be implemented over a five-year period for most business. Those businesses with over 100 employees will be phased in over three years.

Here are some of my reasons why.

It is wrong to tell a women that she must go to term and have a child she did not plan for or want. Many unwanted pregnancies are caused by birth control failure, unavailability, or expense. (Before the ACA, many insurance policies did not pay for women’s birth control). It is interesting to note that the ACA required no co-pay birth control. As a result, the numbers of abortions fell to new lows. Despite this remarkable achievement of reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies, the republicans were hell bent on eliminating the ACA, the very reason unwanted pregnancies and abortions are down.

Job creation and job growth should begin and end right here at home – not halfway around the globe.

Social Security and Medicare must be Strengthened and Preserved.

I also support the elimination of closed primaries. Why should anyone be prohibited from voting for their choice of candidate simply because they choose to be identified as a Democrat,Republican, Independent, NPA, or any other party? People who choose not to participate in any formal political party and choose to register as independents should be permitted to have their voices heard in primary elections.

Several easy changes will eliminate some of the backlog at the VA. First, for returning soldiers there should be a presumption that the injury is service-related, and the government should have the burden of proving it is not service-related in order to deny the claim. Second, disability payments should begin to flow to the veterans immediately, not after all the determinations and appeals are over. Finally, the Code Of Federal Regulation (CFR) must be simplified to make the process not so daunting for our soldiers returning who are making the difficult transition back into civilian life.

We must also increase the capacity of the VA for veterans to be able to see doctors when they are ill. The facilities with the largest backlog must be the priority even if the government needs to rent extra space and place more doctors there in order to treat our vets. Additional space could also be rented in order to increase access for routine check ups and well visits. Businesses increase capacity when demand far outstrips supply, yet our government, and representative, refuses to do so. PRIVATIZATION is not an option as the care for our soldiers would not be better or cheaper than.

Most hospitals are moneymaking entities and yet they are classified as non-profit corporations paying no taxes. The same is true with many health insurance companies. Many are also privately owned, not publicly traded, and are very, very wealthy. Many are also funded through municipal bonds. Baycare is a perfect example of this. In 2013, Baycare had a net operating profit and revenue in excess over expenses of $631,838,000. This was on an overall revenue of $2.568 billion. Look at this document on page A-23. Here is a letter to the SEC from Baycare substantiating the non-profit status and private ownership. Consider the $631 million profits just for Baycare facilities. This $631 million profit is derived from insurance companies. This raises two important questions. How can this profit of $638 million not be taxed? Secondly, is it really the lack of competition causing the rising of health care costs, or the unmitigated greed of hospitals and insurance companies? Baycare also has assets of 5.6 billion. Baycare uses the laws to their benefit and there is unfortunately nothing illegal in what they do. It is unfortunate that there is no way to find out who the real owners of Baycare are. Wouldn’t it be something if it was owned by insurance companies? I am just using Baycare as an example because they control 50 percent of all beds within our congressional district. I can assure you that Baycare, as a non-profit health care provider, has a smaller operation and profits then many others throughout Florida and the nation.

Tax Reductions for Us

Please contribute to my campaign so I can continue the fight on this issue for us.

Rejuvenation projects in communities can work to eliminate urban blight, renovate old buildings and warehouses, re-purpose spaces, (which could provide affordable housing in some instances) and encourage new business to come back to our urban neighborhoods.

This would:

I fully support the right of Employees to organize, unionize, and collectively bargain. Our stagnant wages, lower standard of living, lower savings, and job insecurity, is a direct result of the Union Killing legislation being enacted in the states and through our Congress.

I was raised by a single mother with three sisters. I can say, without a doubt, that women possess the sensibilities, intelligence, and ability to make healthcare decisions, including her own reproductive decisions, just as a man possesses for his own decisions.

How? We will be bled dry by wall street. We will be charged transaction fees, administrative fees, loads, accounting fees, and the list goes on if we have to invest our own social security money. Unlike the bailouts banks and insurance companies receive, there will be no bailouts for us, as there never are. We will be at the mercy of the market and market manipulators that sell stocks short, sell against the box, call options, put options, straddles, struts, derivatives, and all the other controls professional speculators use to separate us from our investments.

3) It is also imperative that we fix the eroding infrastructure across the nation. Bridges are crumbling, dams are weakening, roads can’t support even normal traffic volumes, and our electrical grid is old, unreliable, and a security risk. These are just a few of the problems I will work tirelessly to fix. We are supposed to be the best nation on earth and yet our infrastructure is third world in its current condition. These infrastructure improvements will immediately create good paying jobs and strengthen our economy, further creating purchasing power and more new jobs.

2) We must also expand on the renewable energy equipment manufacturing, sales,installing, and maintaining. Renewable energy creates over 5,000 good paying jobs a month. This is more then the entire fossil fuel industry. There is no reason that we continue to rely on fossil fuels that destroy our environment, has job growth stagnation, and is a limited resource capable of large cost swings.

If single payer is unobtainable, and the only option is modifying Obamacare, the following is what I would fight for.

4) increasing the minimum wage through legislation and/or union strengthening.

RIGHT TO VOTE

I vehemently oppose any attempt to privatize any part of social security and/or Medicare.

Increasing Minimum Wage

We must begin to protect our environment. Clean air and water is a necessity and we must preserve the EPA and reverse all of the unconscionable actions by the current administration. We must also fight climate change or global warming or what ever other name assigned to it.We must end our dependence on fossil fuels. This means a permanent ban on offshore and inshore drilling and an end to fracking. The incredible increase of earthquake activity around fracking operations is astonishing. Renewable energy creates more good paying jobs per month then all the fossil fuel industries combined. They do not harm the air, water, or environment and is economically less expensive. We must fully embrace renewable energy and use all government resources to compete globally. We must also limit carbon emissions to slow the heating of our planet and the shift of the ocean and air currents. As a result of these changes our earth and the inhabitants are going through great challenges. The great barrier reef is bleaching (dying) due to warmer waters and pollution and animal species are at risk, such as the right whale which did not appear to have bread this year and avoided its normal travel patterns. The higher temperatures and pollution have affected the worlds bee population. Bees are the workers that pollinate most of the produce grown for human consumption. When they die we will suffer. I will be a loud and persistent voice for the rapid increase in renewable energy research, production, manufacturing, and usage while killing off fossil fuels. Renewable energy is also a great means of powering mass transit such as high speed trains. China and Germany are great examples of what is possible. (It used to be America was the great example). Lets make America innovative and the world leader again.

I am Pro-Choice and Pro Reproductive Rights which include both the right to have children and the right not to be forced to. It is remarkable that this debate continues, in spite of the 1973 decision of Roe. I fully support a women’s right to choose her own future, including reproductive choices.

Under privatization, people would have to invest their money for retirement. Most of us, would not invest that money but we would rather spend it to pay for unnecessary things like food, housing, clothing, and utilities. The problem is not that the government takes too much for social security, the problem is that we are paid to little to have both social security taxes taken out AND to invest money. The rich do not care because they have their own nest eggs, and they want to feather their nest more with our social security money.

I will fight for the immediate automatic restoration of the RIGHT to vote for people who are convicted felons immediately and automatically after completion of their probationary or incarceration sentence.

What will it take for Wall Street and Main Street to treat people equally? How hard is it to pay women the same as men for the same work? Should we encourage pay discrimination lawsuits? Maybe use the justice department to impose civil fines? Maybe bringing back the ERA and create lawsuits for violating civil rights? DO we shame these companies into compliance? There is undeniable that white women are paid less then men for the same work and this discrepancy is greater with minority women. This is unfair to the worker, and detrimental to families and slows economic growth for the nation. It is much easier for companies to fix this internally, then the costs associated with new legislation.

As your Congressman, I will fight to strengthen Social Security and make it a continuing part of our countries safety net. I will fight to increase the income level caps to $175,000. I will also add to the source of taxable income dividends, capital gains, and interest carried forward, to ensure the persons whose income are not W-2 based, are unable to avoid their fair share of the expense of society’s safety net that we all share.

Since what we are doing is not working, why not try something new. Lets try being a good neighbor.

I am a supporter of medical marijuana and have been for years. Fundamentally, one of the things that has bothered me is the governments prohibition against terminally ill patients using marijuana to fight their illness or improve the quality of their remaining life.

Together, we can improve and strengthen the national economy by raising the minimum wage, working towards a single payer health insurance company, and creating tax deductions that benefit the middle class and working poor.

Twenty-two soldiers commit suicide every day. That’s more than 8,000 men and women in uniform who take their own lives every year. Our current representative has done very little, if anything, to stop it – despite being on the subcommittee for Veteran’s Affairs. There has been no meaningful legislation by him or his sub-committee for mental health support, medical care, or any of our soldiers’ other unmet needs.

The refusal of businesses to pay a living wage forces hard-working people onto the roles for public assistance, including health insurance subsidies and food stamps, shifting the burden from private enterprises to the public. This is nothing less than welfare for businesses. Put a different way, if business paid a living wage, our state and federal government would not have to use tax payer money to keep these people from being homeless, hungry, or without health care.

I have been asked my position on Union vs Right to Work by both voters and the National Right To Work Committee. Here is my response.

It is many politicians’ view that the VA should be privatized or our soldiers should be dumped into the regular health care system.

Lastly, any appropriations legislation for war authorization or use of force must consider the increase in wounded soldiers from combat operations and include a percentage of funding for the VA. This should be funded before a penny goes anywhere else.

I support pay equality for women. With that being said, I have to ask how are we still dealing with this issue?

Social Security & Medicare

There are very few things that are more un-American than prohibiting a person from voting by placing obstacles in their way. These restrictions include shortened and inconvenient voting times, limiting early voting, and prohibiting a person from voting after they have served a prison sentence. These voter restrictions adversely affect the elderly, minorities, and the poor. Convicted felons work and pay taxes and are effected by the same laws passed by Congress that we all must follow. It is repugnant to the very basis of our democracy to permit this continued “taxation without representation.”

Privatization, no matter how well it is marketed to us, is a suckers bet. It is nothing more then a giant handout to wall street. Social security, as it is now is nothing more then insurance by the government that we will have some income when we retire. It only costs us the tax we pay through our paychecks, there are no other expenses.

The war on drugs is a national disgrace and waste of both treasure and blood. It is time to rethink all of it.

I not only support medicinal marijuana, I will fight to legalize marijuana.

It is time to normalize our relations with Cuba. There is no benefit that I see to continue this cold war mentality. No benefit for us, and no benefit for the people.

I support the LGBTA community and their fight for equality. All people have the right live their life and be happy. I support equality of all persons. It does not matter who someone loves or what gender they identify with, what matters is that they have the ability to love.

I am 100% pro-choice and pro-equlaity.

My Position and Reasoning on Unions.

It is a sad testament to our current leadership that many people who work 40 hours or more a week are still living below the poverty line.

I am opposed to both of these solutions. We MUST fix the Veteran’s Affairs. Our soldiers have special needs due to their service- — including health issues that span physical, emotional, and mental scars. Although everyone wraps themselves in the American flag and says to soldiers and their families, “Thanks for your service,” and wave banners that say, “We support our troops,” our politicians, and we as a nation, have done nothing to show we really mean it. It is appalling. Giving lip service to phrases like “thank you” and “we support you” does not relieve us of our promises as a nation. More importantly, it does not relieve us of our MORAL OBLIGATIONS to the brave men and women.

Cost less then what we currently spend on healthcare.

Eliminate the $150 aspirin and the disparity in costs for identical care based solely on the type of insurance carried. It is idiotic that the identical procedure costs the consumer differing amounts depending on the insurance coverage they carry.

Significantly increase patient options, patient satisfaction, better health care, better delivery of care, cheaper prescription drugs, and the best part; eliminate the profit incentive and the inherent conflict of interest in the private care model.

Increase practice profits as most doctors would actually get paid more.

Premiums paid for health insurance under either and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or commercial plans will be deductible. As a side note, I support Obamacare, however I think it should be tweaked and some things changed. The politicians, who keep saying they will “repeal and replace Obamacare” are misguided. For many years they have controlled both chambers of Congress and could have proposed any corrections or even a new plan. Obamacare does NOT need to be repealed before it is replaced or changed. All Congress has to do is write Legislation and change it. They obviously know how to do this because they pushed over 60 votes to repeal Obamacare or parts of it.

Eliminate the need to purchase Bodily Injury Protection car insurance, thereby saving us more money.

Childcare expenses will be deductible without the need to have a cafeteria plan through the employer.

Eliminate a very large part of medical negligence lawsuit awards, thereby reducing costs to businesses and persons, again saving money.

Bring down the costs of hospital care and prescription drugs for the consumer through direct negotiations and caps with ALL hospitals and drug manufactures. No longer will there be a treatment for a disease that is cost- prohibitive to the average person. No one should have to cut their pills in half or die because they can’t afford the treatment prescribed. A perfect example is the Hepatitis C treatment that costs in excess of $100,000 a year or the price gouging that occurred to AIDS medications last year. President Bush signed into law the prohibition against the government negotiating drug prices. Why do we pay the most for prescription drugs than any place else in the world when many pharmaceuticals are created and manufactured right here in our own country?

Save business hundreds of millions of dollars each year in health care costs for current employees and retirees. This would provide money to businesses to pay a living wage, hire new employees, expand capacity, update technology or equipment, expand, and remain globally competitive.

Allow veterans to use any doctor they want in ADDITION to the VA for second opinions, treatment, or mental health.

Out-of-pocket expenses related to healthcare will also be deductible.

Create larger profits for businesses both large and small because of the net effect of a healthier work force, less sick days being paid, and significantly reduced health care costs.

Eliminate coverage limitations to the “home market” and cover injuries and illnesses no matter where they occur.

Eliminate anyone from interfering with the medical decisions made between patient and his or her doctor. It would make sure the government stays out of the decision-making process. More importantly, it will REMOVE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES from the decision-making process by eliminating exclusions from coverage. The insurance companies will no longer be able to say, “I’m sorry. That is not covered” or “I’m sorry that doctor is not in your network”. We will no longer be restricted to doctors within a geographic boundary or provider network. Healthcare will be simpler and easier to navigate for everyone. The only choice we will have to make is which doctor to see for the best outcome possible. After all, it is not the government that interferes with the patient-doctor relationship it is the insurance company. The insurance companies dictate who can treat us and what we can be treated for. It’s time to say “enough.”

Allow interest deductions on credit cards, revolving credit, and automobile loans up to $15,000.

Save each consumer thousands of dollars a year in health care related expenses, thereby giving them more money in their pocket to spend, save, invest, open a business, retire, travel, enjoy life, give to kids, pay off a mortgage early, or any of a thousand other choices. All alternatives are better for the economy and the well being of the consumer than paying an insurance company.

Renewable energy is also a great means of powering mass transit such as high speed trains. China and Germany are great examples of what is possible. (It used to be America was the great example). Lets make America innovative and the world leader again.

Let me be very clear, corporations and the super rich do not care about us, our success, or failures. They want us to buy their products and give them our money. We have heard from Republican leadership for decades, ‘give them tax breaks and they will create jobs.’ Do you want to know why corporations and the top two percent are richer now and we in the middle are struggling? It’s because they got their tax breaks, and we got the shaft. They now own over 60 percent of our nation’s wealth and they aren’t about to ‘trickle it down’ through jobs or higher wages. They would rather export jobs, put us out of work, and grow their own profit margins at our expense.

“My positions are very simple and crafted through common sense:

Together, we can make all these goals a reality.

Country must always come before party in policy considerations.

Lastly, I will work to create an environment that fosters job growth, higher wages and lowers the cost of living. Cutting taxes for the rich and corporations does not create jobs. Consider this, interest rates for them to borrow are lower than ever before and they are sitting on trillions of dollars in cash. Why would more tax breaks motivate them to create jobs when they have most of the money now and control more each year?

While the Republican leadership has been working for corporations and the wealthy elite and the Democratic leadership has been busy working for the poor and minorities, we in the middle have been ignored and financially squeezed.

Veterans Affairs (the VA) must be properly funded, which it has not been the case for a long time. According to the Bi-Parisian Congressional Commission on Care, the VA is in need of $25 billion due to under-funding from Congress over the past 10 years. My opponent Gus Bilirakis’ position has consistently been against any additional funding for the VA. It is the lack of funds, outdated systems, and outdated facilities that have caused the waiting times and the failures of the VA and put the health and lives of our veterans at risk. This intentional under-funding by Congress is the direct cause of the soldiers that have died waiting for care.

Employment opportunities must be created through several methods. First, people must begin to buy goods and services from locally owned small businesses. Second, good manufacturing jobs that have been exported to countries like Mexico, China, India and Bangladesh must be brought back to America. Third, America’s infrastructure is crumbling and the jobs that will be generated to update roads, bridges and transportation systems have the potential to employ hundreds of thousands of American workers. Fourth, federal money must be made available to local districts to eliminate urban blight, fix drainage systems, or whatever local needs exist. Fifth, eliminate federal regulations that are unnecessary and enacted for the purpose of eliminating competition.

I believe Social Security and Medicare must be strengthened and protected from privatization. This safety net is imperative. Any argument in favor of government agencies placing social security money into the free marketplace is irresponsible. Privatization would end up being nothing more than a giveaway to Wall Street. Aside from being at the mercy of the banks and Wall Street, the money will be dissipated and lessened through transaction fees, loads, management fees, and other hidden costs, and threatened by the volatility of the market.

WHY I OPPOSE PRIVATIZATION

Why Vote Tager and Not Bilirakis for Congress

 <tag> p




WHAT IS PRIVATIZATION Privatization is when our Government gives to private companies the work the Government is responsible or obligated to perform. The Government’s function is to provide the services it is obligated to such as the Military, law enforcement, promote the general welfare through education, social safety net, economic growth, regulating interstate commerce, and the health of our citizens. These are all important functions.

Gus Bilirakis has been in Congress since 2006 when he took his fathers congressional seat. Based upon his votes and support for legislation that harms Social Security, Medicare, VA, against fighting climate change, against job stimulants, economic recovery, middle class, it is time for a new and different Voice. The following are his votes. Some of my positions are laid out immediately after his harmful voting

My plan for the VA involves many different components. My bullet points are not working but I am working on correcting the problem. Sorry. First and most important is to immediately fund the VA appropriately, taking into account the huge numbers of Veterans that have returned from active duty post 9-11. Money must be spent in the locations where the waiting times are the longest

I am appalled at the misinformation and apathy towards our Veterans and Department of Veteran Affairs, and I want to shed some light, backed by actual facts. Tonight I was reading some posts about the VA and comments by many people and veterans that were critical of my opponent and his empty support of Veterans. I also saw posts from one of his outreach staff

I have been asked my position on Union vs Right to Work by both voters and the National Right To Work Committee. Here is my response. I fully support the right of Employees to organize, unionize, and collectively bargain. Our stagnant wages, lower standard of living, lower savings, and job insecurity, is a direct result of the Union Killing legislation enacted in the states and

Nothing is more important than the health and security of the people government serves. So why are we still debating on common-sense healthcare and insurance solutions?

Medicare for all is self explanatory so while

Bilirakis C0-Sponsors Bill Against Social Security and Medicare In Co-Sponsoring HR25, Congressman Bilirakis has again shown that he wants to privatize social security and turn medicare into a voucher program forcing seniors to buy their own health insurance. HR25 will significantly harm and weaken social security and will eliminate funding for medicare. In the Co-Sponsored Bill, Congress found in section 2(b): “Findings Relating to Federal

I know the pains of unemployment, low wages, high student loan debt, preexisting medical condition, and struggling to just make ends meet. I fear the future for my family and yours if forward thinking, "Progressive" ideals are not implemented.

 <tag> p


I am asking for your vote and support so I can become that voice.

I am running for Congress because our voices are either not being heard or are being ignored. My opponent has had over ten years in the U.S. House of Representatives, and he has consistently failed to advance or support legislation that helps us in the bottom 98%. It is time for a new PROGRESSIVE voice.

I know the pains of unemployment, low wages, high student loan debt, preexisting medical condition, and struggling to just make ends meet. I fear the future for my family and yours if forward thinking, "Progressive" ideals are not implemented.



I am the father of two wonderful boys and a rescue dog that is as tough as she is sweet. I was born in North Miami Beach, Florida in 1966. I grew up in Florida and attended school in Florida.

I am running for Congress, because I understand the importance of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid as safety nets. The speed at which personal finances and health can change for the worse and the difficulty of making enough to pay living expenses while saving for retirement make such programs a necessity – not an entitlement.

I am running for Congress because my opponent has consistently voted on the side of big corporations, big oil, big pharmaceuticals, and against the interests of the poor, working poor, and middle class for over a decade. Enough is enough.

I am currently a practicing attorney and am self-employed. Practice areas include criminal defense in both the State and Federal Courts. Prior to striking out on my own, I was an Assistant Public Defender at the Office of the Public Defender in Hillsborough County, (13th Judicial Circuit) and the Public Defender’s Office in Pinellas and Pasco County, (6th Judicial Circuit). I have seen many problems of our Judicial System first-hand including the school-to-prison pipeline, unjust sentencing schemes, conflicting laws, the destructive and unjust consequences of the war on drugs, minimum mandatory sentences, and excessive use of force. These are just a few of the problems that should be corrected through criminal justice reform.

I earned my Associate of Arts degree from Broward Community College and a Bachelor of Business Administration with a major in Finance from Florida Atlantic University. While there I served as vice-president of the Student Body at the Broward Campuses for two years. I received my Juris Doctorate in 1997 from Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida. During law school I served as the Student Bar president for two years, and was also a member of Moot Court. I have lived in the Tampa Bay area since 1998, and my congressman is now also my opponent.

I know the difficulty first hand of not being able to make ends meet. I know how it feels to be hungry and what it is like to live off of ketchup sandwiches, and when times were good, Velveeta cheese sandwiches with tomato soup. I have experienced being short of rent money and what it is like to come home with the electric turned off. I have experienced both sides of our socioeconomic system – the “haves” and “have not's.” The feeling of Despair is devastating.

I am proud to say I was able to support myself throughout my college career. During the Christmas break I would often have a full-time job and part time seasonal work. I have worked in many different industries and roles including manufacturing, unloading freight, stocking shelves, delivering pharmaceuticals, cooking, retail, and whatever else I could find to make ends meet while going to school full-time. I also held low level management positions at Target and Walden Books.

I am the man I am today because of the love and faith of my family, my religious faith, and my refusal to quit or give up. My life experiences provide an acute understanding of how frustrated people feel who work and do everything they are supposed to do, and yet still experience life within, or on the edge of, poverty. My life experience, upbringing, education, and faith have forged in me a personal strength of conviction for what is right and what is wrong, social justice, and progressive view of the world.

I am running for Congress to give a voice to the people of District 12, who have never before had one. Unlike my opponent, I know what it means to be part of the working poor or working and struggling to get ahead. I know the heartache of despair.
