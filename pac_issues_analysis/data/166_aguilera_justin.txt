ABOUT

HOME

Living in Silicon Valley, the most expensive housing market in the country, makes it unattainable for many to own a home or own a home near their work. We can combat this issue with high-speed public transportation allowing many to commute from a more affordable location.

I’ve lived in Santa Clara County my entire life. I was born and raised in the East Side of San Jose. My grandparents were dairy farmers. I am proud of my community. I attended Valley Christian High School and then California State University Monterey Bay. I majored in kinesiology and was a collegiate athlete. I’m happily married to my beautiful wife, Candace. I am a businessman and work in a family owned company. I felt that I could make a difference, as a servant of my community, when the promise of “Hope and Change” never came to fruition. I want to take action; I respect the opportunities that I have been given. I want to see citizens, of this bountiful land, become successful and live their dreams. We are all dreamers and we can all live a great life, united and working together to achieve our goals. We must implement our laws and protect our borders. I support legal immigration. I believe in small government and lower taxes. I salute and stand for a strong military. I only kneel for one person. I support second amendment rights. It’s time for a new generation. It's time to hold the toxic disaster of Washington D.C and California accountable.; Together We Stand, Together We Unite. Vote Justin Aguilera on November 3rd.
