CREATING A NEW REALITY

 <tag> p


Muhammad’s training, experience and long-time standing as an independent leader/voter is respected across the spectrum of diverse leaders from Atlanta to New York to global stakeholders.

Community work at the grassroots level and small business community development have kept Muhammad’s ear and hands on the ground and his eyes on the public policy/political scenery. Over the years, he has developed lasting relationships within every strata of metro Atlanta leadership, Georgia state government/legislature, and the U.S. Congress.

Free of party restraints, Muhammad can speak and take action across party lines on the tough issues that matter most to the people who live in the 5th Congressional District. Known for his direct, “hands-on” ability to improve conditions, especially for the poor and disenfranchised within urban black communities, Muhammad is running to create balance across the 5th District -- and a new reality. With a nonpartisan approach, he is uniquely positioned to advance criminal justice reform, prevent destructive gentrification, ensure affordable housing, training, and jobs -- and provide authentic public engagement.

A deeply established small business leader and community advocate, he and his family have been rooted in Atlanta and the 5th District for several decades.

Muhammad is bringing that stakeholder participation model to the United States Congress for the diverse citizens of the 5th District. As an Independent, he is free from the restraints of party politics, lobbyists, special interests and corporate agendas.

As a community organizer, Muhammad has consistently implemented a highly effective, diversity-based model for communication outreach and participation. His participation model welcomes and includes leaders across neighborhoods, communities, small businesses, and faith organizations.

Time-tested over the years, Muhammad has been successful in being a champion of the people and going head to head as well as toe to toe on behalf of the oppressed and those locked and left out.

Muhammad is known for bridging the gap across small business, community, and religious lines. He is recognized as one who gets invited to the round table to lend his experience for hard decision-making programs and ideas for the community.

Committed to Creating A New Reality across the 5th District by focusing on the District’s areas of severe economic imbalance, Muhammad is declaring this platform pledge to District 5 voters:

Muhammad Wants Systemic Reform in the following areas:

He will continue to do the same for the voices of those needing higher wages, affordable housing rates, and criminal justice reform within the 5th Congressional District.

- U.S. Congressional Candidate Muhammad

 <tag> p


Muhammad traveled throughout the United States participating in a series of “Men’s Only” lectures that led up to the notable Million Man March in Washington, D.C. on October 16, 1995. Serving as Southern Regional Director during the Million Man March, Muhammad was accountable for the Million Man March efforts from the Deep South. With over 1,000,000,000 men present that historical day, the Southern regional office under his guidance ranked second nationwide, directly behind National headquarters in Chicago.

Muhammad has lectured with distinct organizations: Lucent Technologies, Morehouse School of Theology, Interdenominational Theological Center (ITC), Family Federation Church, Candler School of Theology at Emory University, American Clergy Leadership Conference [(ACLC) The Nations’ Largest diversified organized group of clergy], Peachtree Road United Methodist Church and numerous others. In 2008, he traveled to help organize Global Peace Festivals for both Atlanta and Washington, D.C., where Rev. Dr. Joseph E. Lowery, Bishop George Augustus Stallings, Jr. and Rabbi Mordecai Waldman spoke, among other prominent leaders.

Honoring this pursuit, Muhammad is a Candidate in the 2020 Special Election to fill the remaining term of the late U.S. Congressman John Lewis of the Fifth Congressional District in Georgia.

S teven Muhammad was born in Chicago, Illinois. He and his lovely wife Margaret have been together for over thirty years. He is the father of four children and eight grandchildren.

Muhammad was instrumental in organizing the tenants of the Bedford Pine Community in Atlanta’s Old Fourth Ward during his GSU years. Serving as Chair for the Neighborhood Planning Unit (NPU-M), Muhammad worked with concerned citizens throughout the City of Atlanta to close liquor stores and remove drug dealers from community parks and crack houses. It was during this time he received his formal introduction to Islam. Since then, Muhammad’s work has led to staff positions, including major regional accountabilities of the Nation of Islam. He served as Southern Regional Minister of Finance, responsible for the Southern states of Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Eastern Tennessee. His responsibilities then expanded to all 14 Eastern seaboard states from New York to Florida.

Muhammad grew up on the South Side of Chicago during a time of racial tensions across the United States. Moving to Atlanta, he enrolled in Georgia State University with the desire to study law. While at GSU, he founded the Black Student Alliance and became instrumental in having the first Black studies program be implemented at the public university. The program remains in the curriculum today.

I n 2015 during an organizing speech for the 20th Anniversary of the Million Man March, the call was made for 10,000 Fearless Men to stand between the guns and the gangs within their community. The speech led to Atlanta establishing the first office facility for 10,000 Fearless Men and Women in the neighborhoods of Vine City and English Avenue, one of the country’s top drug-related crime areas. Their Fearless presence has been acknowledged for reducing violence and crime. Muhammad’s life long pursuit thus continues the focus on Safe and Decent living within the Black community. Just as he personally went with community patrols around the Clark Atlanta University Center during a recent tragic murder of a female student, Muhammad is maintaining a “hands on” approach.
