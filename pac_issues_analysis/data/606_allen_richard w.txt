About

 <tag> p




I’m a devoted husband, father, and grandfather, and I’ve worked hard to serve my community and my church.

I hope you’ll give me the honor of letting me serve you in Congress, too.

I’ve spent the last 37 years building my construction company from the ground up in Augusta, Georgia.

Small businesses, our nation’s job creators, are being taxed and regulated to death and are struggling to stay afloat. More Americans than ever are in danger of losing their homes. This is unacceptable.

PAID FOR BY RICK W ALLEN FOR CONGRESS

We need to build on the foundation of our nation’s economy by loosening Washington’s grip and letting the free market do its job.

It is clear that Washington is broken. Job-killing policies, overregulation, and antiquated tax laws have plagued us for far too long, stifling American entrepreneurism. It is time to get Washington back on the path to a prosperous economy and I will fight to make that happen.

I’m a conservative small businessman, I’ll bring my experience in job creation and principled leadership to Congress to combat the growing reach of the federal government into the lives of every American.

After prayerful consideration with my family and many words of encouragement from friends, I am proud to announce my campaign to replace John Barrow with a conservative family man and small business leader. Georgians are telling me it’s time to replace out of touch politicians with conservatives who know what it means to live within a budget and create jobs.

I know firsthand about creating jobs in spite of the obstacles put in place by the federal government. After I graduated from Auburn University’s School of Architecture and Fine Arts with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Building Construction, I founded R.W. Allen & Associates, a construction corporation with offices in Augusta and Athens.
