"As a nurse, entrepreneur, wife, and mother who has lived in Indiana's Fifth District for 30 years, I am prepared to take my real world business experience, first-hand knowledge of our healthcare system, and conservative values to serve our state in Congress.

Support Our Cause

I'm asking for your support as I work hard to earn the opportunity to bring my heart for service to Washington."

I have found her agenda is not a selfish personal one, but an agenda to keep America a place that my grandchildren will be able to live in and still have the freedoms I have enjoyed

Beth you're going to win this seat. I'm all in for Beth.

Beth Henderson is the ideal partner and voice for our Fifth Congressional District ... She understands the needs of the people who call the Fifth home.

I'm supporting Beth for 5th district Congress because of her common sense, her business experience, her medical care expertise, and the fact that she is also a constitutional conservative.

We need more strong conservative businesswomen and nurses in congress like Beth.

PO Box 115

In my 91 years, I have never felt so compelled to follow a leader like I am with Beth Henderson.

I endorse Beth for Congress because of her strong Midwestern values and commitment to our fiscal conservative principles.
