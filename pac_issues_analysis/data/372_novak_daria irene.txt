I understand how damaging our taxation system is becoming and reform is needed. Part of my struggle in Congress will be to highlight the issue of high taxation and put the decision back to the people. I will fight for tax cuts by any means necessary. Taxes are taking a toll on people’s lives in America and reform is badly needed to ensure that we provide adequate funding to the services we need without sending people into poverty that are trying to earn a living. Tax cuts are important and something that I feel passionately about. I will push to have them enforced If Iam elected to congress.

When I get into congress I intend to work towards a stable monetary policy that will benefit my constituents all those that I represent. Overall the financial system in the United States needs an overhaul to bring it into line and to allow a better quality of life for those who live under the system. One of the main financial pledges I will make is to increase to the minimum wage within the United States. At present the current system cannot properly support people in low paid jobs or impoverished areas and I hope to change that.

The United States of America is a global pillar of strength and security within the world. Through congress I hope to contribute to maintaining peace and prosperity throughout the United States and its territories. If Iam elected to stand in congress I will ensure that your voice is heard when discussing current affairs and that our troops are looked after. One of the United States greatest assets is its military and I intend to ensure that our military has all the necessary equipment and support they need to undertake their operations worldwide.
