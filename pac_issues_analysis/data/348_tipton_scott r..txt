Scott's experience and background is as a job creator, managing 22 employees at Mesa Verde's peak. Through his career as a small businessman, Scott has learned first hand that government does not create jobs, people do, and he takes this experience and philosophy with him to Congress. This real-world knowledge of the obstacles and risks taken on by our Country's entrepreneurs is an experience that is too often lacking in Washington, D.C.

Living and working here I understand the importance of agriculture and water in our district; I understand public lands; the importance of being able to access and preserve them while responsibly developing our natural resources.

Congressman Tipton will continue to support Colorado’s farmers and ranchers

HR 6467 would allow cities and counties with fewer than 500,000 people to apply directly to the US Treasury for Coronavirus relief funds for their communities, ensuring they have the same access to resources as Denver and other large cities.

Agriculture adds $40 billion to Colorado’s economy and creates 170,000 jobs.

Every community in Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District has fewer than 500,000 residents, as such this bill would benefit every corner of the district. That is why it has also received support from a number of localities in the 3rd, including Grand Junction, Alamosa and Pueblo.

Congressman Tipton joined many of his House Republican colleagues in supporting The Farm Workforce Modernization Act to simplify the H-2A program so farmers can legally get the workers they need to keep costs low for Americans and compete in the international market

If a farmworker is here illegally, under the proposal, they have a chance to come forward and get legal status as an agriculture guest worker, not citizenship, but temporary legal status that will allow them to continue to support U.S. agriculture. If they come here for temporary work, the bill streamlined the visa process so they don’t have to come here illegally. That’s not citizenship, that’s not amnesty. It prevents illegal immigration, is more secure, and gives us a better idea of who is here. The bill also requires employers to use E-Verify. Nowhere in the bill does it discuss citizenship or a pathway to it, let alone any type of amnesty, which Congressman Tipton opposes.

A pathway to guest work is not the same as a pathway to citizenship.

The only thing this bill has to do with Boulder is that Boulder also has fewer than 500,000 residents, as do most places.

There is no special provision in the bill for Boulder or anywhere else. So, to say it is some type of Boulder bailout is a lie.
