Raúl Grijalva (D-Arizona), the new chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, sent a pointed letter to David Bernhardt, the acting secretary of the Department of the Interior.

Raúl continued his service to the community when he was elected to the Pima County Board of Supervisors, where he served from 1988 to 2003, including two years as the Board’s Chairman. At the Board of Supervisors, he was a staunch advocate for balanced planning and fairness in land use decisions. His leadership led to the creation of the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan.

From 1974 to 1986, Raúl served on the Tucson Unified School District Governing Board, including as chairman for the last six years of his tenure. The community looked to Raúl as an advocate for teacher and employee rights, civil rights, and increased funding and support for public education. He was instrumental in the establishment and implementation of bilingual education in Arizona as well as the creation of the magnet school programs in Tucson during desegregation. Raúl M. Grijalva Elementary School was named in his honor after he retired in order to recognize his service and contributions to education in the Tucson Unified School District.

He continued his advocacy for working families, reinvesting in older and minority neighborhoods by passing the first bond package that contained a $10 million commitment to reinvesting in older, low-income neighborhoods and the funding of a housing trust fund. He worked with community advocates to pass Countywide Universal Inclusive Home Designs Standards. These standards, the first in the nation, were applied to all new housing and provided simple, minimal cost design changes that make homes more accessible for people with disabilities and older adults.

Raúl began his public career as a community organizer and continues to be an advocate for underrepresented constituencies in Tucson and Southern Arizona. In the 1970s, he joined other advocates at El Rio Community Health Center, (a once small local community health services clinic that Raúl and several others established in Tucson), to encourage local governments to invest in older and minority neighborhoods.

Representing Arizona’s 3rd Congressional District, Raúl first ran for Congress because he believed in the power of bringing people together to improve our communities and make our country a more just place. Throughout his career, Raúl has always fought for underrepresented voices.

Raúl has a thirty-year record of exceptional public service in Southern Arizona. Raúl, his wife Ramona, and their three daughters, Adelita, Raquel and Marisa, have a lifelong commitment to improving the quality of life in the Southern Arizona community.

He helped organize neighborhood empowerment efforts that prompted the City of Tucson to expand services to the south and west sides, including the construction of neighborhood service centers such as El Rio, El Pueblo and Fred Archer. He served as Director of the El Pueblo Neighborhood Center from 1975 to 1986.
