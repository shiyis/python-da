Health (See also BUDGET, below) : Basically I'm seeing 4 kinds of health care improvement plans: 1) Enhanced & improved Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) 2) Actual Medicare for All (lower the eligible age to zero, still requires supplemental insurance, and since Medicare is optional, it would be a "public option") 3) [Enhanced] Medicare for all (existing strengthened, to eliminate the need for supplemental insurance) 4) Single Payer (100% coverage, like Taiwan, often being mislabeled Medicare for All) I would vote for any and all of these. My Budget, below, pays for the first two - if the other two are adopted I can rework my Budget.
