It is also my view that the Federal government does have a constitutional responsibility to support economic growth. The starting position on this topic is what should we allow or expect from our federal government? National Security, yes. Reducing the National Debt, yes. Interstate regulation, yes. Social welfare programs, debatable. But without a doubt government programs supported by our representatives must be prioritized against a balanced budget and funding must be based on expected revenues and sometimes voted against just because there isn’t room in the budget. We cannot sustain political ideas that are not tempered with budgetary reality. So, I will vote for a balanced budget, reduced taxes, continued deregulation and economic policy that supports private sector growth and solutions.

Bill Schafer is running to unseat a Freshman Democrat in IA-03, a district Trump won in 2016.

Predictability, sustainable policy, and lower taxes drives job growth and family stability. Our federal government must provide oversight on the economy, but should not be an impediment to State economies. Interstate and international economic policies are critical to economic growth and national security. As your congressman I will support deregulation to encourage growth and infrastructure maintenance to ensure long term strategy and international policy that is balanced against local economic impacts.

It is my strong view that the sacredness of human life is from conception to natural death. God himself places equal value upon all human beings regardless of the circumstances surrounding their conception. We as a culture, as a Christian People, and as a Nation must not accept the idea that it is acceptable to end the life of a pre-born child as a choice to be made for convenience. As your congressman, I will fight to ensure that "We the People" protect the life and health of both the Mother and the Child. As Pro-Life advocates we must also demonstrate our care and concern for trauma victims; not default to abortion as a solution but rather care for the victims' mental and physical health and offer avenues of choice for the care of the infant upon birth. As your congressman, I will support legislation that defends life;similar to the current efforts to achieve a "Heart Beat Bill" and separate legislation that provides victimized women with genuine care for both their physical and mental health and offers avenues of healthy choices for the care of their infants upon birth.

It is my view that even the best of our career politicians have created an unfavorable view of our congress and the uncooperative environment of Washington. I think "We the people” should encourage a return to Statesmen Service with our elected representatives. I will cosponsor and vote for the U.S. Term limits Amendment of three (3) House terms and two (2) Senate terms. Introducing and supporting a term limit amendment will help in improving our representative government.

During my military career I had the opportunity to command in the Infantry at platoon, company, battalion, and brigade level. I deployed to combat leading America's Sons and Daughters first during Operation Desert Storm as Commander of C–Company for the 5th Cavalry and again to Operation Iraqi Freedom as Commander of the 1st Battalion 12th Infantry. I have served in the Pentagon on the Joint Staﬀ and as Operations Oﬃcer and Chief of Staﬀ for a 3–Star Headquarters. My military awards include most notably 2 awards of the Bronze Star for Valor. I am a graduate of a Senior Service College, an Army Ranger, Master Parachutist and Expert Infantryman. I have been recognized with the Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit and as a civilian with the Superior Civilian Service Award.

National Security is the first most important role of our federal government. I have served this Nation and our Nation's Soldiers for 37 years. Now I want to serve Iowans with that same sense of duty and integrity that guided me in the United States Army. An important and current issue in this regard is the illegal invasion at our Southern border. As your congressman I will work to solve the crisis on our Southern border and every port of entry. The solution must include three parts: 1) Border barrier with electronic surveillance 2) Resources Border Patrol agents and 3) Enforcement of laws preventing business from hiring and support to our business in identifying illegal aliens. We must work together to stop the tragedies perpetrated by illegal aliens like the one that devastated our great state recently.

Our country was built on self-reliance. The strength of our Nation is the people’s ability to solve problems. It is my view that we are coming dangerously close to eroding our Bill of Rights. First Amendment: We need to strengthen an understanding of freedom of speech. I will vote against any law or standard that interferes with religion or free speech. I will defend the right of our citizens to speak freely and recognize that the consequences of free speech come from your fellow citizens not the government at any level. Second Amendment: I will vote against any law or standard proposed that limits your right as an individual to keep and bear arms. The debate on public safety should be about the development of and enforcement of laws that discourage and punish criminal behavior not laws that focus on a specific tool used by a criminal. Tenth Amendment: As your congressman I will work to ensure federal solutions where our constitution indicates and push for State and local solutions at every opportunity.

Health care at the Federal level has become a complex issue. An unnecessary and long bill that brought too much oversight to the federal level. The requirements have become an unsustainable burden on business and forced many individuals from a private to government system of healthcare. Our government agencies should not be overseeing healthcare execution! I will work toward solutions that favor health care decisions between families and health care professionals. I will work toward reforms that lower costs, expanding insurance options. We should consider separating routine and minor emergency health care coverage from pre-existing and life-threatening conditions to ensure treatment without risking bankruptcy.

S1 E22 "Bill Schafer for Congress"

Not endorsed by the Department of the Army or the Department of Defense

Hello, my name is William Schafer. I go by the name Bill. I am the son of a soldier. My four siblings and I grew up in many states around the country. I have served our nation and our soldiers for 37 Years. I served in the Infantry because I love our soldiers and I am genuinely proud of our country. During my last active duty assignment at Rock Island Arsenal my wife, Robin, and I fell in love with Iowa and Iowans. We have been Iowans for eight years now and have chosen Iowa as our home. On 11 May 2019 I resigned my position with the Department of the Army to serve the great people of Iowa and our Nation as a United States Congressman.

Bill Schafer discusses his aspirations and hopes for Congress.

PAID FOR BY BILL SCHAFER FOR CONGRESS

Former Iowa Congressman David Young faces a primary challenge for Iowa's 3rd Congressional District's Republican nomination.

Like all Iowans I am concerned with the conflation of Immigration vs. Border Security. First, we must recognize these are separate and distinct issues. I will be a strong advocate of legal immigration reform. I will help deliver standards of entry, requiring future immigrants to become American citizens and strongly encourage these Americans to enrich our country with their heritage. With our border secure and our legal immigration policy strengthened we will be in a great position to debate the status of the current population of illegal immigrants within our country.

I am a Conservative Republican who believes that Iowans and Americans are best at making decisions for themselves and their communities. I will push for local and state solutions to issues prior to seeking federal solutions unless directed by our United States Constitution. I am motivated to run for congress because of my sincere belief that it is time to take action rather than complain at the coﬀee table. My purpose for running for oﬃce is to advance conservative values, protect our constitution, and solve problems for my fellow Iowans as their representative in Washington. With the support of the great people of Iowa District 3 it will be my honor to continue my life of service for the people of Iowa.
