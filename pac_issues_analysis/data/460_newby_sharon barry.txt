(727) 459-2530 | info@shari4congress.com

I have a very high regard for those that serve in the military. My dearest friend was a Ranger in Korea during the worst fighting. My father was stationed at Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu when Pearl Harbor was attacked the morning of December 7. He then served 44 months in the South Pacific during WWII. My husband was drafted into the Army and served in Viet Nam for 13 months as a finance officer at Long Binh just after the Tet offensive began. During my husband’s tour of duty and my first year of teaching, I watched helplessly for months as our politicians went back and forth with the enemy over the shape of the negotiating table! At the same time Hanoi Jane was personally providing encouragement to the Viet Cong!

Primary emphasis, should I be elected, include restoring our thriving economy, reducing health insurance costs, reinforcing social security benefits while reducing taxes on contributions, slowing immigration to foster assimilation of immigrants, protecting the 2nd Amendment and improving education K-12, especially in civics and history. Today’s curriculum should better reflect local priorities, values and needs.

P.O. Box 5165, Largo FL 33779

In the universities, leftist leaning, tenured professors and unions with deep pockets have done great harm and thwarted free speech. They’ve preyed on our college age young people. The agenda of these "educators" has left our impressionable adolescents with a lack of respect for their forefathers, a distorted interpretation of our history and doubts pertaining to our form of government. This erodes pride and patriotism.

Copyright © 2020 - Sharon Barry Newby - All Rights Reserved

Helping Donald Trump heal this country is my primary goal. I believe this president will be remembered as one of our greatest, but a small window of opportunity remains to complete his agenda. Challenges left by the Obama administration are unforgiveable. The obstruction, corruption, hate motivated impeachment and lack of accomplishments by Pelosi’s House is unparalleled. Republicans must take it back.

I am a proud member of the NRA, love dogs and horses, water sports, ballroom dancing, playing poker, listening to crooners such as Dean Martin and Sinatra, as well as watching the Golden Girls. Fox is my news channel. I support Judicial Watch, the RNC, the Leadership Institute, the Republican Party of Florida, Hillsdale College, Prager U, the ACLJ, the Presidential Coalition, Wounded Warriors and several churches.

In 1977 my family moved to Florida. We purchased a small, retail music business and worked almost exclusively with seniors and churches. Hundreds of free community concerts and lessons were offered. The transition from teaching to business owner was full of unexpected challenges. At the onset interest rates surged to 21%. We were paying over $10,000/mo. interest on inventory for over a year under President Carter. At the same time, our customers invested in high yielding CDs instead of purchasing instruments. We managed to keep all 12 employees on staff during this time. Many businesses failed and we witnessed the demise of dozens of American piano and organ brands, partly because competitive products came into the United States at prices below their cost of production. They were being subsidized by foreign governments. This is called dumping. Our elected officials did not protect domestic manufacturing. Out of the dozens of US piano and organ manufacturers, few have survived and all those jobs have been lost forever. Thank you, President Carter. In 1980, thanks to Ronald Reagan, the economy improved and interest rates moderated. We would have lost everything had it not been for President Reagan.

My mother’s family owned an electrical contracting business in Lincoln. I graduated from Lincoln Community High School (the Railsplitters), and Illinois State University, a teacher’s college, with a Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education. Following graduation, I taught 7th grade for a year in Eureka, IL (home of Ronald Reagan’s alma mater) and 6th grade in Bloomington, IL for the next 6 years. In the summer I sold real estate. During my teaching career I was never a member of the teacher's union.

I'm Shari Barry Newby and I'm running for Congress to represent you the people of District 13. I have been a resident of the Tampa Bay area and business owner for the last 42 years. Currently, I own a music company in Clearwater, specializing in large, custom musical instruments for homes and churches in Florida and the Caribbean. I employ computer technicians, musicians and teachers. We are one of the nation’s top dealers for the brands we represent.

Finally, criminal activity in Washington must be punished regardless of party affiliation.

When I was very young both my family and my husband’s family owned farms close to each other. I have great respect for that lifestyle and the everyday challenges of the hard-working people that live it. I was born in Lincoln, Illinois, a small farming community rich in the heritage of its namesake. It was named after Abraham Lincoln before he became a nationally recognized figure. The circuit rider was well known in our mid-state community. My hometown was actually christened by Abraham Lincoln with a watermelon!

Watch the first eight minutes if you dare!

Every citizen of this country should listen to this speech Reagan gave at the Russian University in 1988. A remarkable conclusion of a 3 day visit to Moscow. Reagan's truth and charm are desperately missed today. Under the bust of Lenin, with its irony and symbolism, Reagan delivered this speech to an enthusiastic and polite audience. I highly recommend this video....

The timeline Maria Bartiromo is talking about is the lynchpin to indicting several people in the Obama administration.

Flagwaving for Trump - so much fun and so many drivers honking and giving us a thumbs up.

I was pleased to be invited to the Central Pinellas Republican Club by their gracious President Barbara Stephens. It was a wonderful December gathering of devoted Republicans working for the reelection of President Trump. Lots of fun, information and good food.

After my recent trip to the Cape Kennedy, and reflecting on the phenomenal accomplishments of so many brave citizens, I am compelled to ask the question, "Why don't today's democrat leadership want to identify with the American flag?" Tears came to my eyes after realizing that Kennedy would not recognize his own party. Pictured with me is Astronaut Tom Jones.
