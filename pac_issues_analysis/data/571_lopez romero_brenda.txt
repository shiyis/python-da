“And for every person who told me I could not, there has been another who told me I could. Those people helped make me who I am. It has become a guiding value in my life: that as I achieve success, I will lift others up with me.”

I define service an individual in a position of privilege or influence that ensures the doors of opportunity are opened, remain open, and are opened wider, in other words, to democratize access, resources, and knowledge. It is one of the best principles of the American character to open doors to all the next generations and that is the definition of service we should aspire. But it is a principle that is not freely given, but rather, it must be intentionally provided.

“My career path has always been about service. Even though I grew up with limited means, and faced language barriers, and have felt the hand of discrimination, I still feel privileged. I still feel lucky that I live in a country where you can immigrate at 5 years old without knowing the language, work hard, and one day start your own law firm and become a State Representative.”

“Brenda Lopez is a proven legislator who knows how to get things done, and that’s exactly why we need Brenda to run for the United States Congress. I proudly join this effort, because Georgia deserves a leader like Brenda in Washington.”

“I’ve worked with Brenda Lopez when she was in the State House Education Committee to ensure that voices that are often unheard were heard in policy making. Voices like teachers, who work day to day with our children in our schools, and I know that she is going to fight to include such voices when she gets to Washington.”

“Having fought alongside State Representative Brenda Lopez Romero in the Georgia General Assembly, there is no doubt that Brenda’s leadership and voice are what Georgia’s 7th Congressional District voters so desperately need in Washington. Brenda is no stranger to breaking glass ceilings, and it is time we elect a strong American of Latina heritage to Congress.”

We don’t hold our leaders accountable for the actions they take and the words they say. It is time that we stop using race and ethnicity to scapegoat the innocent and divide the impressionable. We need leadership that brings communities together and puts #peoplefirst
