“The climate emergency demands that we only vote for climate emergency candidates. In this race there is only one climate emergency candidate and it is Shahid Buttar.”

“We need a visionary committed progressive like Shahid in Congress—especially given the need to aggressively check and balance this criminal administration.”

press@shahidforchange.us info@shahidforchange.us (415) 761-3475

“I have known Shahid for over a decade, and his work on national security, surveillance, criminal justice and policing issues have been a consistent point of pride within communities impacted most by these policies.”

“Shahid Buttar is everything that Congress needs – brilliant, principled, young and incredibly committed, empathetic, insightful and especially articulate.”

Pelosi’s deep connections to the American ruling class has means her fundraising is unparalleled, but she lacks the broad support that real progressives like AOC have found in their districts. She may have won 17 races, but she’s also happy to sabotage health care reform and the Green New Deal, and, not coincidentally, these acts of sabotage translate into billions for her backers.

“Shahid will represent the values and priorities of all Californians with the utmost integrity and brilliance. It’s time for fresh true progressive leadership!”

Paid for by Shahid Buttar for Congress (not corporate money)

“Nancy Pelosi and her deep-pocketed corporate funders have led California and our country into the obscene wealth inequality that we experience today. Shahid Buttar is the kind of principled, corporate-free, bold progressive candidate that will help us chart out a new direction that puts people before profits!”

”I am proud of the thousands of us who called for a new Speaker of the House other than Speaker Pelosi. And this [statement] of hers is but one of many reasons why I’m endorsing and campaigning for the brilliant leader Shahid Buttar in a primary against her.”

“I enthusiastically endorse Shahid Buttar. Shahid has fought long and hard for protection of civil liberties and human rights for our communities. I know that he will continue to work non-stop to defend human rights over property interests.”

“I’m standing with my dear brother Shahid. As a truth teller he is absolutely trying to make sure that the corporate wing of the Democratic Party can be transformed in the name of everyday people.”

“Shahid is the leader we need right now. He has been fighting for our rights for years – boldly and unapologetically.”

“I endorsed Shahid Buttar’s primary challenge to Nancy Pelosi in 2018, and I’m proud to do so again for the 2020 primary, especially as Pelosi has allowed herself to be played by Trump on American concentration camps and mass ethnic-cleansing raids.

Our campaign has received endorsements from many local organizations and social movement leaders in San Francisco and across the country.

“Shahid represents the best traditions of America. He has defined himself as a builder of movements and a courageous fighter for change. We need people like him in Congress: politicians who represent “We the People”–not the corporations and the military-industrial complex that have ruled this country for decades.”

Congressman Shahid Buttar would immediately join forces with new Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who want to stop the ‘appeasement of Trump’ culture in Washington and forge a new egalitarian and humanistic direction for our country.”

“In 1969 I was born and raised in San Francisco. I’m tired of people holding office that don’t care about education, police reform and the community that live around toxic superfund sites. I support Shahid Buttar because not only does he care, he shows up.”

“With her recent attacks against newly elected progressive Democrats (all women of color) and her support of funding for Trump’s expanded ICE raids, Nancy Pelosi continues to show how out of touch she is with San Francisco.

“I endorse Shahid’s primary challenge to Nancy Pelosi. He is the leader that we need right now to take on the influence of money in politics, the environment, criminal justice reform, and labor rights which will not survive or tolerate any more centrist inaction.”

“San Francisco needs new bold and courageous leaders in Congress who will unapologetically stand up for immigrants, women, working families, and my teen daughter’s generation who will bear the brunt of climate change. I support Shahid and his campaign’s on-the-ground organizing in our communities and his clarity in challenging the corporate elites that threaten our civil liberties, labor rights and economic opportunities, and peace and justice in the world.“

By contrast, Buttar — a human rights cyberlawyer turned EFF community organizer — has a slate of AOC-aligned, progressive policies that will change the lives of everyday Americans for the better, and might just help maintain the habitability of the only known planet in the universe capable of sustaining human life.”

“We need to take a strong stand for the progressive vision that many of us feel is absolutely essential, not only for the future of our country but also for this next election. And as a consequence, I am now endorsing Shahid Buttar for the congressional seat in the San Francisco district where Nancy Pelosi now serves.”

“Nancy Pelosi has moved far away from progressive principles, relying on big corporate money and the military-industrial complex to set the limits and define supposed realism for her role in Congress.”

“At a time when few lawyers—and fewer politicians—were willing to embrace #MarriageEquality for same-sex couples, Shahid stood by me, as well as my constituents who wanted to marry the partner of their choice.”

No honeymoon: Activists on the left prepare for a possible Biden presidency

Pelosi ignoring calls for debate

 <tag> p

June 12, 2020

Pelosi has not debated an opponent since her first race for Congress in 1987, and she has demonstrated no interest in sharing a stage with Shahid Buttar, the child of Pakistani immigrants, attorney and democratic socialist who is running against her in November.

In November, for the first time in her 33-year congressional career, Pelosi will be challenged for her San Francisco seat in a general election by a fellow Democrat, who calls her insufficiently progressive. If she’s worried, she doesn’t show it — she won’t even respond to his calls for a debate.

Candidate Statement

 <tag> p


In 2004, I represented the second mayor in the country (Jason West from New Paltz, NY) to support the right of LGBTQ couples to marry. As a Muslim man raised in the midwest, I was fighting for LGBT rights in the courts nearly a decade before Nancy Pelosi—with all the privilege & power of the Speaker of the House—deigned to even publicly recognize the equal rights of my gay neighbors at the federal level.

It’s that future to which I’m dedicated.

Labor donated | Privacy Policy | Colophon | Jobs

I’ve seen Pelosi cover up CIA torture, fund CBP concentration camps at our nation’s borders, and revive expired NSA & FBI spying powers from the legislative dead to empower our racist-in-chief—even while falsely claiming to mount “resistance” to him. None of these were acts of so-called “resistance.” Every one—as well as her legislative record more generally—reveals the picture of an agent of the establishment who claims progressive values while only rarely supporting them in fact.

And it’s that future that I’ll aim to protect—on behalf of our city and future generations—when I represent San Francisco in the House of Representatives.

I’ve also fought for our city’s values well beyond its borders.

press@shahidforchange.us info@shahidforchange.us (415) 761-3475

It’s that future which has animated my work over the past 20 years.

It was ultimately Pelosi’s long record of enabling human rights abuses that forced me to enter politics. I’ve spent much of my legal career in Washington, where I saw Nancy Pelosi‘s work up close. While I worked both in the grassroots and in the policy sphere to defend San Francisco’s values in the face of her misrepresentation, she consistently advanced the interests of Wall Street and three-letter “national security” agencies.

That concern is not new to me. It has animated my activism, grassroots organizing, professional advocacy, and nonprofit leadership for 20 years.

Paid for by Shahid Buttar for Congress (not corporate money)

My work promoting San Francisco’s values has taken many forms. In 2003, shortly after graduating from Stanford Law School, I started an weekly outdoor convergence among politicized poets and musicians in the Mission that has continued for 17 years. A few months earlier, I mobilized a network of Stanford students to participate in a nonviolent siege of the financial district along with 20,000 other Bay area residents the morning after Bush invaded Iraq.

As a Muslim candidate challenging an entrenched, powerful incumbent, I’ve been subjected to attacks in the press and local political organizations leveraging implicit biases and racial tropes.

Predatory, for-profit corporate “healthcare” was both brutal and vicious before the coronavirus pandemic. In the face of a global viral contagion, allowing cost to remain a barrier to care is senselessly idiotic. That policy choice has already driven thousands of Americans to early graves.

I advocated for the law that in 2019 made San Francisco the first city in the country to ban face surveillance technology in the hands of government agencies. I previously wrote provisions of other groundbreaking local civil rights laws adopted in jurisdictions across the country, from Berkeley (in 2011) to Providence, Rhode Island (in 2017).

The white supremacy enabled by the local political establishment has been profoundly disappointing. I remain confident, however, that San Francisco is willing to judge candidates on the basis of our actions and character, rather than contrived accusations spread by politically motivated critics.

Many have come to fear fascism in the United States, particularly over the course of the last year under a criminal President aspiring to be a fascist tyrant.

In addition to helping establish marriage equality, my work defending privacy and dissent has also had national significance.

Meanwhile, the dedication of corporate Democrats to fossil fuel extraction threatens to kick billions of people off a climate cliff. Because they are either too young to vote, or because they live elsewhere, they’re unable to participate in this election—even though it could prove crucial to determine the contours of their future.

I’m running to represent San Francisco in Congress because the future can’t survive the predation of the past. The same voices in Congress who have engineered our current crises are not likely to generate effective solutions. We need new voices representing communities that have been excluded from the halls of government for too long.

As a Muslim immigrant and constitutional lawyer, I’ve been a canary in the constitutional coal mine of the United States. I’ve warned for two decades as our rights, liberties, and democratic transparency have eroded in the face of a continuing bipartisan assault.

The past year has made the case for our platform more poignantly than any campaign ever could.

In addition to his work as a public interest advocate, writer, and artist, Shahid also serves on the Boards of Directors of the Center for Media Justice, Defending Rights and Dissent, and the Fund for Constitutional Government.

His wide-ranging work reflects a commitment to intersectional feminism, democratic socialism, and international human rights. His passions have long aligned around a common purpose: building the movement to put human rights and human needs before corporate profits.

Since graduating from Stanford Law School in 2003, Shahid has worked in both San Francisco and Washington as a legal advocate, a non-profit leader, a grassroots organizer, and a poet & musician.

An immigrant of Pakistani descent from the United Kingdom and the youngest of four children, Shahid grew up in the midwest and first came to the Bay Area in 2000 to study law at Stanford.

After growing immersed in the movement to end the war, Shahid moved to Washington to work for Heller Ehrman LLP, a San Francisco-based law firm that later collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis. His work there included litigation championing the right to marry the partner of one’s choice—nearly 10 years before the Democratic establishment finally embraced marriage equality—and an appeal defending bipartisan campaign finance reform from being undermined by the Federal Election Commission.

Paid for by Shahid Buttar for Congress (not corporate money)

In the wake of Trump’s election, Shahid combined his passions for justice and music by founding Movement, a series of quarterly parties in San Francisco supporting local non-profits that serve immigrant communities, such as Causa Justa / Just Cause and Asian Pacific Islanders Legal Outreach.

While a student at Stanford Law School, he served as Executive Editor of the Stanford Environmental Law Journal and professor Lawrence Lessig’s teaching assistant for Constitutional Law. He also spear-headed a campaign to promote sustainable building practices by the university, a day of action to shut down a Lockheed Martin facility, and a student strike against the war in Iraq.

His writing for Huffington Post, Truthout, the Burning Man Journal, Tech Crunch, Project Censored, and academic legal journals addresses a wide range of issues, from foreign policy and counterterrorism to human rights and torture, from transparency and drone strikes to voting rights and tax law, from the crisis in executive power and corresponding threat to democracy to the bait-and-switch surrounding police body cameras.

press@shahidforchange.us info@shahidforchange.us (415) 761-3475

In addition to LGBTQ rights, privacy, and the right to encryption, Shahid’s work has also advanced immigrant rights, campaign finance reform, government transparency, international human rights, and police accountability. His writing has explored issues from the right-wing attack on reproductive freedom to the erosion of voting rights, and from effective counter-terrorism strategies to examples of counter-cultural activism promoting progressive politics at the intersection of art and organizing.

Through his work building movements for peace, immigrant rights, black lives, and the Occupy movement, Shahid dedicated his career to public service long before he sought public office.

An early advocate for marriage equality for same-sex couples and a prolific organizer in the movement to end warrantless government surveillance, Shahid most recently built a national grassroots network for the Electronic Frontier Foundation as the organization’s Director of Grassroots Advocacy.

Outside of his work as an advocate and organizer, Shahid performs as a DJ, MC, and poet. He also organizes artists, and has co-founded several collectives of politicized performance artists on both coasts.

He later founded a program at Muslim Advocates here in San Francisco to challenge racial & religious profiling by federal agencies such as the FBI, whose abuses of constitutional rights to dissent span nearly a century.

Before passing the California bar exam in 2003, Shahid met three other poets at an open mic in SoMa hosted by the legendary Diamond Dave. Together, they founded the outdoor poetry convergence that has graced the corner of 16th & Mission every Thursday night for the past 15 years.

Since joining the SF-based Electronic Frontier Foundation in 2015, Shahid envisioned and launched a national grassroots network, represented the organization in the media and at public events from coast-to-coast, and frequently wrote for public audiences to explain the implications of EFF’s commitment to digital rights for policy issues from mass surveillance and encryption to net neutrality and restrictions on police.

In between, he participated in Burning Man for the first time, before returning many times to perform documentary poems, rock revolutionary rhymes, and share socially conscious music for camps from Pink Mammoth and Heart Phoenix to Opulent Chill and TransFOAMation, while helping build art projects from the Solarium and the Heart Phoenix to the Sonic Runway.

For six years, he led the Bill of Rights Defense Committee (now known as Defending Rights and Dissent) as its Executive Director. The organization was founded in response to the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act to help everyday Americans in hundreds of communities across the country fight at the local level for their constitutional rights.

In 2002, while studying law at Stanford, Shahid co-founded the Stanford Spoken Word Collective, which continues to recruit & train poets in the Collective’s 18th year.

STORE

As a national non-profit leader, he built a national progressive legal network at the American Constitution Society while in Washington to help correct the conservative bias increasingly pervading the federal courts.

A few months later, he founded the DC Guerrilla Poetry Insurgency in Washington.
