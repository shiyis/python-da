“HRC is proud to endorse these pro-equality champions for the U.S. House of Representatives...”

“We are excited and proud to endorse this expansive group of pro-Israel champions who have consistently demonstrated a steadfast commitment to our Democratic values, including maintaining the United States’ alliance with Israel.”

Your local officials that endorse Lois Frankel for re-election.

"We endorse candidates for national office who work to protect reproductive health and rights and who demonstrate a strong commitment to working on behalf of women and families around the world."

"I am pleased to announce that [Lois] received the endorsement of the political action committee of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW-PACE: Political Action for Candidate Election) for the 2020 general election campaign. NASW’s membership of nearly 110,000 professional social workers, including our Florida chapter, join me in extending support for [her] campaign in light of [her] commitment to the well-being of individuals, families, and communities." - Mary Jane Lundgren, RN, MSW, Chair, NASW-PACE Board of Trustees

"Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund endorsed a slate of candidates for the U.S. House and Senate who have championed gun safety."

"Moms Demand Action Gun Sense Candidates are candidates who are running for office in 2020 and have demonstrated that they will govern with gun safety in mind."

Talk is cheap; Frankel works. In this contest, the incumbent is the clear and only choice."

"We're making this endorsement because we know we can always count on them to support LGBTQ+ equality. From passing the Equality Act to allowing patriotic trans service members to serve openly to blocking the Trump Administration's attempts to enshrine discrimination in federal regulations, Florida's Democratic Congressional Delegation will do what's right, fair, and just.”

Endorsed for reelection based on "how a candidate has voted on LGBTQ+ issues and how a candidate has supported the Palm Beach County LGBTQ+ community”.

"The re-election of U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach, is as vitally important to the nation as to the voters of District 21, to whom we strongly recommend her... Frankel’s career has been one of integrity and diligence as a Florida legislator, mayor of West Palm Beach and four-term member of Congress. She holds one of the prized seats on the Appropriations Committee, where she has worked tirelessly to protect the Everglades and improve Florida’s ports. Her entire voting record mirrors the values of the vast majority of people in her district."

"Frankel continues to be a key voice in Congress on issues that resonate with the district, from supporting the ACA, improving entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, while pushing to expand Medicaid to providing funding for water resources programs and climate change adaptation.

"The political will evidenced by [Lois Frankel] to fight for clean water makes [her] the fight-for-the-public servant we proudly endorse."

Endorsement for reelection voted by "over 300 delegates who made their voices heard as part of our 2020 Committee On Political Education Endorsing Convention."

"We're proud to endorse these fighters and champions for women and families!"

"In order to have elected officials who will make the right environmental decisions we need to elect the right officials."

"We are very grateful for Congresswoman Frankel’s support for the Assault Weapons Ban and other gun safety legislation."

"The Florida State Association of Letter Carriers is proud to endorse [Lois] for the Florida Congressional District 21 seat. [Her] work to support the United States Postal Service and letter carriers is welcomed. It demonstrates that [she] is a true champion and friend of not only the 18,300+ letter carriers across Florida, but also to the 290,000 active and retired letter carriers across the country."

"We’re showing up across the country for candidates who promise to go above and beyond to protect and expand health care access."

"The Democratic Environmental Caucus of Florida proudly endorses [Lois Frankel] for U.S. House of Representative, District 21. We applaud [her] commitment to the environment and to the people of Florida."

Endorsement for reelection based on "NOW’s priority legislation and electing feminists who will pass them – such as raising the minimum wage for all workers, removing the artificial timeline on the Equal Rights Amendment, equal pay, paid sick leave, paid family leave, federal abortion protections and universal health care."

"Your positions demonstrate a strong commitment to ensuring that all Americans have the secure retirement they have earned. We welcome your leadership on issues such as strengthening and expanding Social Security and Medicare and protecting them from cuts. Our members support your candidacy because of your belief in more affordable health care, including lower drug prices, pension security, and quality long term care. The Alliance for Retired Americans believes that your election to the House of Representatives will enhance the quality of life for older Americans."

"[Lois'] outstanding advocacy and leadership on animal welfare issues is indicative of [her] keen attention to these issues... We are grateful for [her] expressions of support for a range of animal welfare policies."

"We are thrilled to announce that [Lois] received the endorsement of the Florida for All coalition, a locally rooted coalition of progressive organizations, including Dream Defenders, FLIC Votes, Florida Planned Parenthood PAC, New Florida Majority, Organize Florida, and Service Employees International Union Florida. We recognize that [she is] invested in fighting for an authentic democracy in our communities and will continue to advocate for housing, education, healthcare and criminal justice systems that work for everyone."

"Lois Frankel will work to expand access to quality, affordable healthcare and protect voting and civil rights. That's why we're supporting her for reelection to FL's 21st Congressional District."

"Thank you for your commitment to our community and your commitment championing LGBTQ people and our families."
