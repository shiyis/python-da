CREATING AN EQUAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR ALL

 <tag> p


I’m committed to creating legislation that attracts businesses to open up shop in the Valley and train our workforce for the next generation of jobs. I work with schools, community colleges, and businesses to bring everyone together so that people can work in the jobs of today and tomorrow.



I believe everyone has the right to participate in building a cleaner world. I am constantly creating and supporting legislation to give opportunities for all communities to participate in creating and using clean energy in our vehicles, homes, and throughout our community.

As the youngest of eleven children, Tony was taught the value of hard work and community service. At the age of six he began to go to work for his father and helped with his father’s gardening business every summer and weekend.

As a child growing up in Pacoima, I experienced firsthand the inequalities in our justice system. Everyday in my community and in Washington D.C., I’m working to make sure that our justice system treats everyone with respect and dignity.

Providing a voice for the voiceless has and always will be part of the work that I obligate myself to do. I have created and funded programs that have educated people and saved lives in our city, our state, and across the country.

Justice and Dignity For All

Tony was born and raised in Pacoima by hard working immigrant parents. Andres and Maria Cardenas raised him and his ten brothers and sisters in their Pacoima home since the 1950’s.

Washington, DC 20003

This global pandemic has taken more lives and decimated more families financially than anything we’ve experienced in the last 100 years. I helped write the laws that have provided critical relief throughout this pandemic. I am continuing to do all that I can so that we all can receive the support we need to save lives and keep families safe and in their homes.

Growing up, I saw firsthand how families would make the difficult decisions to feed their families over healthcare costs. I will continue to create a healthcare system that will give everyone access to affordable and quality healthcare services. Healthcare is a right not a privilege.

As an American citizen and the proud son of immigrant parents, I am dedicated to reforming our immigration system that will keep families together.

Thank you for visiting my campaign website. To ensure that our government is protecting the rights of all people, each one of us must commit to actively participating in our democracy. This is why I will work to ensure that families have access to quality healthcare services, we work to create policies that reform our justice system and provide justice and dignity for all, our DREAMERs and undocumented families have a pathway to citizenship, and that we create policy that will preserve our natural resources and fight climate change. Let’s all get involved and act now.

In elementary school, middle school, and high school, he experienced a double standard and was told to have low expectations for himself. His high school counselor told him that college was not for him. Tony had to fight to be given the classes he needed to take that were required if he was going to attend college. He was accepted to the University of Santa Barbara to be an electrical engineering student. When he told his math teacher the good news, his math teacher laughed at Tony and told him “You can’t cut it, they will eat you alive. Try junior college.”

Paid for: by Tony Cardenas for Congress

After receiving his electrical engineering degree from UCSB, Tony moved back to Pacoima and went on to create a successful small business. As a member of the community, running for office was never part of his plan.
