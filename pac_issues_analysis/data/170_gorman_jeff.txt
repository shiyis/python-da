Makes checks payable to Jeff Gorman for Congress.

Jeff believes our Community benefits from volunteer service. He has been active in Monterey civic life: He serves as Treasurer of the Armstrong Foundation, served as a committeeman for the City of Monterey, served as the President of Monterey's Serra Club, served for 12 years as Cal Alumni Club President and four more as Treasurer. Jeff Also volunteers with the Big Sur Land Trust and serves as a volunteer member of CERT- Community Emergency Response Team.

After graduating from college, Jeff began a 23-year career in the financial sector working for 5 years in San Francisco as a bond trader for GT Global. In 1997, he paused his career to intern in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and explore service opportunities at the Federal level.

Public service is in Jeff Gorman's blood. His influences in Monterey civic service starts with his father, Dennis Gorman, whose career was engineering for the City of Monterey. His mother, Dottie Roberson, previously served on the League of Women Voters. Since 1979, she worked for Hank Ketcham Enterprises, which produces the artwork for the cartoon Dennis the Menace. She also sang in the Carmel Bach Festival for over 40 years, one of the longest serving volunteers. Additionally, Jeff's stepfather is a longtime elected leader and current Monterey Mayor Clyde Roberson. All have had a tremendous influence on Jeff, inspiring him to volunteer and to give back to the community.

Being American isn't primarily about guns. Yet being unafraid is a great trait of the American.

Put off by the corruption of the Clinton Administration, Jeff returned home to Monterey to ‘tend his own garden.’ From 1997-2009 he worked as a broker for major brokerage firms, including Paine Webber, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch. In 2009, Jeff ventured on his own and started Gorman Financial. He maintains an office in downtown Monterey.
