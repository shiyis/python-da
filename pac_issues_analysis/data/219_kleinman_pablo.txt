What has Brad Sherman done?

 <tag> p




What has Brad Sherman done? Despite growing international crises, he supported massive cuts to our to defense budget by voting against the National Security and Job Protection Act. Sherman also recently voted against a bill to appropriate funds for the Department of Homeland Security, which despite his opposition was passed and signed by President Obama. Just last year, he voted against a bill to allow the federal government to share its intelligence with the private sector, favoring instead total government control of critical information.

The world is not a safer place when the United States withdraws from it. Trade and security depend on the strength of our military. Peace depends on the assurances of our leaders and the power of our alliances. People longing for liberty and freedom depend on our example. American prosperity and security is put at grave risk when the United States decides to turn its back. Slashing the defense budget, hollowing out our military, spurning our global commitments and shunning our alliances is a recipe for disaster. This does not mean spending more blood and treasure on more foreign conflicts. It means staying engaged and taking the necessary steps to keep the world peaceful, secure and prosperous for the U.S. and its allies. In Congress, I will fight to maintain adequate defense spending, give fair pay to our servicemen and women, stand with our allies, fulfill our treaty obligations, and confront our global challenges. ‘Nation-building at home’ is a complement to, not a substitute for an active foreign policy.

What has Brad Sherman done?

 <tag> p




The future of our economy depends on our ability to create new jobs. Everyone knows the unemployment rate is too high and that solutions to solve the problem are not coming from Washington. Politicians make promises they know they can’t keep, like bringing all manufacturing jobs home from China. They also make promises they know won’t fix the problem, like routinely extending temporary unemployment benefits. What we really need to do is reform the obstacles that stand in the way of job creation: over-taxation, over-regulation, and an education system that’s failing to prepare students for the jobs available. Removing these barriers is more a matter of necessity than principle. We need to make it easier for entrepreneurs to start new businesses, for business owners to expand, and for those eager for work to find and keep it. The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently found that California, with some of the highest levels in the country of taxation and red tape, ranks at the very bottom in job creation and employment. As a result, California is losing jobs not just to China, but to more business-friendly states like Texas. Los Angeles in particular is the only U.S. city to have a net decline in jobs over the last decade. The solution is not to eliminate all taxes and regulations, but to tax and regulate more efficiently. While ensuring fairness and raising the revenue we need, we must stop discouraging entrepreneurs from taking risks and businesses from hiring new employees.

What has Brad Sherman done? In 2009-2010, he authored H.R. 6384, a bill to eliminate ‘Right-to-Work’ laws, which allow workers to chose for themselves whether or not to unionize. It would have made non-unionization illegal. When the bill failed, Sherman quickly erased it from his website.

Pablo attended the USC School of International Relations and graduated in 1994. While there, he continued his involvement with computer networks and joined the temp worker pool at Warner Bros. and later at Disney. Soon after graduating from college and while temping at Disney, Pablo founded hollywood.net, which he envisioned as a means of getting the big movie studios online. In a time in which the most popular internal means of communication at most media companies were still the ubiquitous inter-office manila paper envelopes, Pablo failed to persuade his superiors to give the idea of a Hollywood-wide computer network a shot.

The week Pablo turned 18, he was named South American correspondent for Billboard Magazine, where he initiated the magazine's coverage of the music and media scenes in the region, from the emergence of rock en español to the launch of MTV in Brazil.

Pablo Kleinman arrived in Los Angeles in early 1985 at the age of 13 following in the footsteps of his relatives who began settling in Southern California in the 1940’s. After several years of helping to build his family’s businesses, Pablo’s father set up his first small business in America: a small plastic laminate wholesaler and distributor in South Central Los Angeles.

In 2009, Pablo came back to Los Angeles and settled down in Sherman Oaks. He continued his work as a commentator and became the alternate host of the highest-rated national political talk show on the Univision radio network. He also founded El Medio, the first journal and news syndicate about Middle Eastern affairs edited in Spanish, whose main objective is to provide readers in Spain and Latin America with perspectives about the region that are more aligned with Western ideas of freedom and democracy.

While attending Emerson Middle School in West L.A., a family friend, who was an engineer for NASA, introduced Pablo to computers. Pablo was immediately hooked on the new technology and soon got involved in amateur computer networking. Between 1987 and 1991, Pablo coordinated the development of the Latin American branch of FidoNet, the first free, public-access computer network from Baja California to Patagonia. FidoNet was the first email network in Latin America.

In September 2011, Pablo co-founded his current venture: Urbita, a small network of local search and travel-related online services that is especially popular in emerging markets and currently receives 15 million monthly users.

In 1999, with three other tech consultants, Pablo founded Sabueso (meaning “bloodhound” in Spanish), an online search engine. They set up shop in a space recently vacated by an ethnic beauty parlor on 94th and Amsterdam (Rosie's Shear Magic). Unlike another well-known search engine venture that began around the same time, though, Sabueso didn't survive the dot-com bubble burst and in early 2001 the company was forced to shut down.

This picture is (c) Copyright 2014 Pablo Kleinman for Congress. It may be freely copied and utilized under CC-BY-SA 3.0.

Searching for new horizons, Pablo moved to the East Coast in 1995 where he found work in New York City, first as a translator and then working in advertising. As the Internet began to revolutionize the entire American economy, Pablo joined a group of independent professionals that helped NYC-based companies, primarily in the financial sector, to begin offering online services to their customers.

In the summer of 2001, Pablo was accepted to HEC-Paris, the top business school in Europe. He attended HEC in Paris, an exchange program at the London Business School and worked over the summer in Madrid. When the program was over in 2003, he returned to the U.S. where he was involved in an online music startup in Miami, set up a small consultancy to help new business start-ups, and joined a Fortune 500 Top 20 company as a technology consultant. He also began writing political commentary and appearing on radio and TV. In 2004, Pablo began publishing Diario de América, the first political opinion journal edited in Spanish in the United States.
