ELECTION RESULTS PENDING

The California Democratic stronghold is proving to be too powerful for me to make a sizable dent into the Incumbent’s secure position, even with my running as an Independent. The Republican is coming in a distant second, and I, a relatively close third. Even though votes are still slowly being counted, and will continue to be so until April 3 when they are finally totaled and certified, I should now advise you that, based on the continuing trend, I probably will not be advancing to the General Election.

www,LarryThompsonForCongress

Gratefully yours,

The incumbent, Karen Bass (D), has enough votes already to secure one of the top two positions being awarded to qualify for the General Election. We continue to battle Errol Webber (R) for second place for a position.

ELECTION RESULTS

I want to thank everyone for their patience and generous support throughout the campaign and assure you we put up a loud and strong fight, notwithstanding the present vote count. What you did made a difference, and building on our moderate, common sense, common civility approach to important issues, we go on to make a difference another day.

We presently are a distant third place, but we remain viable as the first votes counted and reported were made up mostly of Mail in Votes and Absentee Votes, which all historically are those cast by older or military people who tend to be more conservative and Republican. As the voting from Vote Centers and other sources continue to be counted and reported, we cautiously, but pragmatically, project to gain on Webber. The State technically has 30 days from Election Day to count and certify a final report. We anticipate knowing long before that.

MARCH 13, 2020

As of March 7, with approximately 60% of the votes in, I remain in 3rd place. The incumbent, Karen Bass, has easily secured one of the two positions awarded for the General Election. I now trail Errol Webber by 3,706 votes for the 2nd position. Stay tuned.

Don’t give up on California. It will return sooner or later to the paradise it once was. I will continue to steer her toward that better moment.

"Larry Thompson breaks down the Stars' strategies in a way that anyone can stop imagining and start living the life they have dreamed of living."

-JANE SEYMOUR

"Stars aren't only found in Hollywood. If you want to be a Star in any walk of life, read Larry's book and learn from his wise advice how to become fulfilled in your life and how to Shine."

"Larry's plan for personal fulfillment and Stardom will make you Shine."

"Engaging, heartfelt, and instructive - Larry's book will start you on the Road To Success."

-WILLIAM SHATNER

-JOHN GRAY, Ph.D., Bestselling Author of Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus

Reflecting upon the extraordinary experiences of his celebrity clients, which have included, Drew Barrymore, William Shatner, Cicely Tyson, Cindy Crawford, Joan Rivers, Jason Bateman, David Hasselhoff, Iman, Scott Hamilton, Barry White, Melissa Rivers, Mariska Hargitay, and Sonny & Cher, Thompson has written an innovative, celebrity oriented, self-help book wrapped within the tinsel of Hollywood but presented to everybody who wants to Shine in their own life and reach their full potential.

-ANTHONY ROBBINS, Bestselling Author and The World Leader in Personal and Professional Coaching

-ROMA DOWNEY, Award winning actress and Star of "Touched By An Angel"

As an author and motivational speaker, Thompson's best-selling self-help book, SHINE: A Powerful 4-Step Plan For Becoming A Star In Anything You Do, was published by McGraw-Hill.

"My friend Larry Thompson, a Star-Maker in Hollywood, extends his expertise to the rest of the world. A must-read for anyone who wants to be successful in business and relationships."

In this pop culture, self-help book, Thompson explains to readers that you don’t have to be in the movies to be a star. He offers sound advice on not only how to look like a Star, but more importantly, how to think, act, live, and become a Star in their own lives. With action-oriented exercises, probing questions, celebrity examples, and personal anecdotes, Larry brings to life four essential elements needed for ultimate success in any field: TALENT, RAGE, TEAM, and LUCK. He provides the prescription and support a reader needs to realize an "extreme motivational makeover" and map out their own unique Road to Stardom.

Larry Thompson, Hollywood talent manager and film producer, is running for Congress in California's 37th District

"With the Presidential Impeachment, there is much disenchantment, disappointment, and frustration with many Democrat and Republican voters. Candidates, like me, running as Independents against the established party incumbents are on the rise in the U.S. As one of the new leaders of this movement, I have christened our mission of help and change with the war cry 'Dobio Swati™,' which means 'Day Of Bull***t Is Over. So, Welcome All The Independents.'"

Be Proud Californians and Patriotic Americans, who respect the laws and Law Enforcement.

13. Represent equally and passionately each woman, man, and child of every race, creed, color, and sexual preference.

14. and Pray to find Common Ground with each other to secure our Future.

Originally from Clarksdale, Mississippi, I have lived here most of my life. I am a Roman Catholic, Moderate, Independent, Energetic, Entertainment Lawyer, Talent Manager, Film Producer, Author, Motivational Speaker, Husband, and Father.

5. Be Proud Californians and Patriotic Americans, who respect the laws and Law Enforcement.

2. Stop the Republicans in Washington from writing us off.

I have lived here most of my life.

I am not a politician. I have been a creative businessman in the entertainment industry. I am used to getting things done. The polarized political positions in our nation have become dangerous in many ways. As an Independent, with a new voice for "ALL of the people of EVERY color," I want everyone, especially our Government representatives, to finally use Common Sense with Common Civility to find Common Ground to solve our Common Issues.

So, "What's Going On?" Let's Start a New Conversation...to Finally Get Something Done.

1. Stop the Democrats in Washington from taking us for granted.

“A New Conversation to Get What Done

Issues

in the 37th District?"

Candidate Statement

9. The solution to Climate Change starts with improving the Political Climate here in the 37th District.

I am that change. I am Larry Thompson. I am not affiliated with any traditional party. I am an independent soul with a no-party preference (NPP). My preference is YOU

Tired and embarrassed of voting your party line and nothing changing for the better for you and your family? Has your party taken your vote for granted, promised you the world, and consistently, over generations, not delivered? It's time to re-examine this new world and vote for a future with positive change.

Embrace and help each other, especially the homeless.

3. Stop our citizens and businesses from leaving our district by making California more affordable.

10. Protect our Hollywood Legacy and incentivize our Music and Film Production in California.

11. Lower our taxes.

8. Improve wages, health care, schools, bridges, public transportation, and the potholes in our streets.

I want, with your support, to use my many experiences and new vision to secure RESPECT and PROSPERITY for ALL. I want to help YOU.

12. Address head-on Comprehensive Immigration Reform.

6. Address every issue, and be giving, reasonable, and lead by example.

4. Embrace and help each other, especially the homeless.

I am pro-America, pro-Israel, and committed to serving the beautiful, cultural diversity of our 37th District.
