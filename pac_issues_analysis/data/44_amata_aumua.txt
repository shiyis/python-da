AMATA COLEMAN RADEWAGEN

Always Working For You

 <tag> p




Amata has been a community activist from American Samoa who volunteers with the hospital Women’s Auxiliary and is a member of Business and Professional Women. A 25-year cancer survivor, Amata has served as a spokesperson for the Samoan Women’s Health Project to promote cancer awareness and bring mammography to the territory and has been the liaison to the National Breast Cancer Coalition since 1993. She also is a member of the board of Field House 100 American Samoa, a non-profit organization devoted to finding athletic scholarship opportunities in the states for talented high school athletes in American Samoa.

A member of the U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leadership Staff for eight years, Amata was Conference scheduling director and supervised the database created to reach out to Asian Pacific and other minority aspirants for congressional staff positions. She also served as scheduling director to U.S. Rep. Philip Crane (R-IL), the dean of the House Republican Conference at the time of his retirement. Earlier in her career, she served at the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. She also was the first executive assistant to the first delegate-at-large to Washington from American Samoa.

My management style is to always be persistent while showing my humility and passion for getting the job done. I will always be there for you; the people of American Samoa.

In 2001, the Hill Zoo online newspaper chose Amata as one of its 52 “Staffers of the Week” from among more than 20,000 Capitol Hill staffers. In 2003 she became the first and only Pacific Islander ever chosen as “Outstanding Woman of the Year” by the National Association of Professional Asian American Women (NAPAW). In 2008, she received the International Leadership Foundation’s Visionary Award and in 2013 was presented the “Inspirational Speaker” Award at the Ninth Annual Samoan Athletes Heart of Champions Ceremony in La Mesa, California.

Amata Coleman Radewagen, Republican, was elected as American Samoa’s third Member of Congress on November 4, 2014. She is the first woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from American Samoa. She is the first Republican woman of Samoan descent in Congress. She is also her party’s highest-ranking Asian Pacific elected federal officeholder in the nation. She has been the most senior member of the Republican National Committee since 2012 and holds the orator (talking chief) title of Aumua from the village of Pago Pago in American Samoa, where she is a registered voter. In winning 75.4% of the vote in her 2016 re-election, she attained the highest number of votes for any elective office in American Samoa history.

A life member of the Capitol Hill Club and a founding member of the American Samoa Society, other affiliations over the years have included the Guam Society of America and the Hawaii State Society as well as the Women’s Foreign Policy Group in Washington and the Independent Women’s Forum. She also belongs to the Pan Pacific and Southeast Asia Women’s Association. Amata’s biography appears in Who’s Who in Politics, Who’s Who in the South and Southwest and on the United States list of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community’s Register of Skilled Women in the Pacific. She also was one of the 100 women profiled in The Women of American Samoa 1900-2000: A hundred years if development and achievements, a book prepared in conjunction with the centennial observances of American Samoa as a U.S. territory.

Amata also has been very involved in helping build democratic institutions abroad. As a trainer since 1992, she has participated in missions to Kazakhstan, Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, and Morocco for the International Republican Institute and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems. She has conducted training in Washington for Iraqi, Congolese and Uyghur women leaders. Other international work has included participation in several Pacific regional conferences.

Amata was a member of the Executive Committee for the 2016-17 Presidential Transition. She was also a member of the Executive Committee for the 2017 Republican National Committee Chairman’s Transition Committee.

Amata was a member of the 1986 American Council of Young Political Leaders study tour of Australia and was elected a member of the ACYPL Alumni Council in 1987. She was a member of the advance team for the historic 1990 Honolulu summit between President George H.W. Bush and Pacific Island leaders and assisted the president’s delegation in the meeting; she also was Washington advance liaison for the vice president’s 1989 visit to Pago Pago.

Amata has a bachelor’s degree from the University of Guam, with additional studies at Loyola-Marymount and George Mason Universities. One of 13 children of the late Governor and Mrs. Peter Tali Coleman, she is married to Fred Radewagen. Together they have three grown children and two grandchildren.

On the Republican National Committee (RNC), she has served on the Chairman’s Executive Council, the Committee on Arrangements for six national conventions and the Standing Committee on Rules. She has attended eight Republican National Conventions, twice has been an Officer of the Convention and has been a member of the Convention Committee on Rules six times. In 2013 she was appointed to the Chairman’s Commission on Convention Planning and, in recognition of her leadership in Pacific Islander communities nationally, received the RNC’s inaugural Trailblazer Award named for Mary Louise Smith, the first woman ever to serve as RNC chairman.

Appointed by President George W. Bush in 2001 as a White House Commissioner for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), where she chaired the Community Security Committee, Amata was the only Pacific Islander on the 15-member commission, which advised the President on AAPI issues and issued a landmark report on the health care needs of America’s AAPI communities. Amata has been the featured speaker over the years at numerous Asian Pacific American Heritage observances, including those at numerous military bases in CONUS and Europe.

In 2017 Amata introduced, Congress passed, and President Trump signed into law legislation naming the American Samoa Veterans Clinic in honor of her predecessor, the late Congressman Eni F.H. Faleomavaega; Vice President Mike Pence accepted her invitation to preside over the designation ceremony.

On April 23, 2017, Vice President stopped in American Samoa to dedicate the new VA Clinic to the late Eni Faleomavega. It was Amata’s hard work that helped build the new clinic and it was also her who suggested naming it for Eni. If you click on a picture, it will enlarge and you can download the picture.
