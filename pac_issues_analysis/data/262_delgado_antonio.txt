#NY19's generosity is unmatched. Thank you, A Single Bite, for delivering more than 70,000 meals last year to folks in Sullivan County. We must do more to end food insecurity. https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/hudson-valley/human-interest/2021/04/25/a-single-bite-celebrates-one-year-of-providing-meals-to-sullivan-county?cid=id-app15_m-share_s-web_cmp-app_launch_august2020_c-producer_posts_po-organic

Congratulations to @HuguenotStreet and the New Paltz community for receiving a well-deserved @NEHgov grant award. We must continue to preserve the rich history of the mid-Hudson Valley. https://nysmuseums.org/shareyournews/10331162

JOBS

Today, @CDCGov released new face mask guidance. If you are fully vaccinated, you do not need a mask outdoors in small groups or when biking and running. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/health/cdc-new-mask-guidance.html

TAX POLICY

Folks getting Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, please make sure to get your second shot. You need the second shot to protect yourself from COVID-19 — one shot is not enough. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/business/covid-vaccines-second-doses.html

HEALTHCARE

 <tag> p




I am dedicated to bringing back real representation by being accountable, accessible and transparent, while working hard every single day for the people of my district.

There's more common ground to be found on the issues than people think — after all, we all want our community to have good-paying jobs, strong public schools, and affordable healthcare.

We can work together to restore the American dream and rebuild our democracy by fighting for universal affordable healthcare, passing a tax code that works for working people and the middle class, and improving economic opportunities for our farmers and rural communities.

Antonio isn't taking a dime from corporate PACs. We're counting on your generous support.

I'm committed to truly serving the people of New York's 19th Congressional District by listening, engaging and finding common ground in order to achieve real solutions.

For too long, hardworking families across Central New York, the Hudson Valley and the Catskills have been left behind by elected officials in Washington who vote to take away healthcare and give tax breaks to the super rich on the backs of working people.

*If you've saved your information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately.

In 2016, according to the unanimous, nonpartisan opinion of all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, the government of Russia stole private information from American citizens, ensured that information was published, and spread targeted fake news stories on American social media. The goal of these new and disturbing tactics was to undermine the credibility of our election and ensure that President Trump was elected.

The men and women who serve our country, along with their families, have made immense sacrifices for our safety and national security. It's not enough to ensure that our service members are well trained and equipped while they are actively serving. Our commitment to the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard members who support and defend the United States around the world every day must extend to taking care of them once they return home.

The farmers in our district have been forced to endure the detrimental impacts of bad trade policies and an unfair Farm Bill. Our district is home to more than 5,000 farms and over 8,000 farm operators. Almost 20% of the land that makes up New York’s 19th is dedicated to farmland. We need to work together to protect our small and medium sized farms and the farming industry.

As a lawyer who has donated countless hours of pro-bono services to people and communities of need, I recognize criminal justice reform as one of the most pressing issues of our time. It is time that we face this crisis head on, with empathy, not animus; with ideas, not impulse; and with courage, not politics.

The impact of the opioid epidemic on our communities has been devastating. Opioid dependency does not discriminate, and I have heard countless stories of painful addiction and heartbreaking loss from people of all backgrounds, income levels, race, and age.

Every member of our community, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, deserves the right to live with dignity and free from discrimination. These basic rights are at the core of our American values. I stand as a strong ally to our LGBTQ+ communities and I will fight to ensure equal rights are both protected and promoted.

I am deeply concerned that our democracy has been under assault in recent years. A small minority of the super-rich and powerful have sought to control our elections using dark money, massive redistricting efforts, and campaigns to repress voter rights. I will work to eliminate corruption and cronyism in Washington D.C.

Working people pay enough taxes. America’s tax policies should put working families and the middle class first, not the super-rich and large corporations. I vehemently oppose the recent Republican tax cuts that benefit the wealthiest among us, and any other policy that funnels tax dollars from the middle class to billionaires and contributes to an already exploding federal debt.

Upstate New York is known for its natural beauty, and we rely on the natural resources of these regions for both personal use and industry. I want to ensure that our environmental policies and regulations protect our land and waterways for the boaters, hunters, fishers, hikers, and sightseers who enjoy our river, our mountains, and our forests year-round – as well as the merchants who rely on servicing these pastimes for their livelihoods.

Our region of upstate New York presents countless opportunities for investment in infrastructure. I will seek funding for projects that address the most immediate needs and that serve the greatest public good, including repairs for the Taconic Parkway, development of our public waterfront, investment in high speed rail for Metro North, and wider access to broadband internet in the rural areas of our district.

Antonio isn't taking a dime from corporate PACs. We're counting on your generous support.

I understand that access to healthcare means nothing if no one can actually afford to pay for it, and that our small businesses have struggled to meet the health insurance needs of their employees. We need to achieve universal coverage as fast as possible. That's why I introduced Medicare X, a bill that creates a public option, giving everyone the choice to opt into Medicare.

Protecting the jobs of the hundreds of thousands of teachers, healthcare workers, service workers, farmers, and factory workers in the district, requires investing in those industries and communities, and protecting the resources upon which they rely.

I understand that a high-quality public education is the key to creating opportunities that will allow our children to realize the American dream. We need to invest in public education to make sure that all of our children get the education they deserve.

We can't afford to keep ignoring the facts. Every day, at least four American children are shot and killed and 19 are hospitalized for gunshot wounds. Overall, 35,000 Americans are killed by guns every year. If any disease were this deadly, it would be considered a public health crisis. We need to start treating gun violence like one.

There’s more common ground to be found on the issues than people think — after all, we all want our community to have good-paying jobs, strong public schools, and affordable health care. My thoughts below are just the start of a longer conversation. I’m always looking for your input, click here to take our issues survey to let me know where you stand.

I support women’s rights to make their own health care decisions. I will continue fighting to defend women’s rights from an assault by the President and elected officials who ignore women’s right to reproductive care. I also strongly support opposing any use of taxpayer money for settlements in sexual harassment suits.

If your intention was to visit my official House of Representatives website, including for resources on COVID-19, please click here >>

I believe that we are a nation of immigrants, and that our region can benefit from a sensible and compassionate immigration policy. I will fight for immigration policies that reflect the character and decency of the people of upstate New York - this means passing a clean Dream Act and achieving bipartisan legislation that fixes our broken immigration system.

ENDORSEMENTS

“Growing up the rules were simple: work hard, do your homework and go to church. The values my parents instilled in me growing up here are the same values that inspired me to run for Congress”

 <tag> p




The combination of skills Antonio gained in his career as an advocate for education, truth, and justice, combined with an approach grounded in hard work, integrity, and love of country, make Antonio uniquely qualified to represent New York’s 19th Congressional District. He is working hard to make sure the people of the district get what they deserve, which is a representative who will actually listen to their concerns and be an advocate for their hopes and dreams.

The truth is though, for many people in our region, the American Dream is no longer in reach. Working families are struggling to climb up into the middle class, no matter how hard they work. The past few decades have seen good-paying jobs like those at General Electric and IBM disappear, with fewer and fewer viable stepping stones for families seeking their share of the American Dream.

The values Antonio learned growing up – hard work, discipline, service and character – helped him get a great education, allowed him the opportunity to start his own company, empowering young people to learn through music, and then begin a second career, as an attorney fighting for what’s fair and just.

“Growing up the rules were simple: work hard, do your homework and go to church. The values my parents instilled in me growing up here are the same values that inspired me to run for Congress”

Antonio decided to run for Congress because for too long, our leaders in Washington have failed to give voice to working families struggling to achieve the American Dream. For too long they have failed to provide a vision forward in an ever changing global economy that’s left thousands upstate New York behind. We need leaders who will listen to the people and not put dollars over our democracy. We need leaders committed to restoring the American Dream.

Antonio and his wife Lacey live in Rhinebeck. They have two sons, Maxwell and Coltrane.

Born and raised in Schenectady, Antonio is a native of Upstate New York. His parents worked for General Electric and benefited from a better regional economy. They worked hard to pursue the American Dream of building a better future for Antonio and his little brother. Antonio attended Colgate University, in Hamilton, New York, where he graduated with high honors and earned a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford. From there, he went to law school at Harvard, which is where he met his wife Lacey, a native of Woodstock and Kingston.
