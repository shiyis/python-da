We must stop unsustainable government spending. Our national debt is $21 trillion dollars and growing. I support President Trump’s efforts to cut the fat in government and restore fiscal sanity to Washington. I also support a balanced budget amendment so we can finally rein in government spending. Like former U.S. Senator Jim DeMint, I will do everything in my power to make sure federal earmarks and pork barrel spending remain a relic of the past. I will strongly oppose any attempt to reinstate Congressional earmark spending.

William is a lifelong and active member of Christ Church in Greenville. In addition to serving in Congress, he is a First Lieutenant in the South Carolina Air National Guard. William studied law and International Studies at the University of South Carolina and also holds degrees in International Affairs and Political Science from George Washington University.

I believe we must hold all of those in federal government accountable for their actions and maximize transparency in everything the government does. Corrupt politicians and bureaucrats need to pay for their actions so we can begin to restore confidence and trust in government.

About William

We must fix our broken immigration system once and for all. I support President Trump’s plan to build a wall, secure our borders, and stop sanctuary cities. I also believe we must end chain migration and go back to immigration based primarily on merit.

As a businessman in Greenville, William formed unique coalitions of business leaders to combat the growing cost of burdensome government regulations and taxes. This collaborative effort inspired him to run for the South Carolina Senate where he defeated a 30-year incumbent. As a freshman senator, he worked across party lines to limit government and make it more accountable to the people.

William began his professional career as a prosecutor in the Thirteenth Circuit Solicitor’s Office in Greenville. In this role, William focused on serving victims of domestic violence and helped create one central court for all domestic violence cases in Greenville County.

I am proudly pro-life and I believe all life starts at conception. I will defend the God-given right to life and actively support pro-life legislation. As a State Senator and private citizen I have promoted adoption, foster care, and Big Brothers-Big Sisters programs and will continue to make these a priority as your Congressman.

Paid for by William Timmons for Congress

The United States Armed Forces have protected the people of this nation for over 200 years and they must be given the resources they need to do their jobs. President Reagan was right - we will only experience true peace through strength. I will always stand with the men and women who have honorably served our nation in the military. I will fight to make sure every veteran gets the benefits and medical care to which he or she is entitled.

William Timmons is an Attorney, Entrepreneur, and U.S. Representative from Greenville, South Carolina.

I am a proud gun owner. No one will fight harder to protect and preserve your 2nd Amendment rights. Government has NO right to tell us how we should defend our family and our property.

William’s strong record as a conservative reformer inspired his classmates to choose him as their representative on the Republican Steering Committee and his background as a business leader helps him represent South Carolinians on the House Financial Services Committee. He and his wife, Sarah, live in Greenville.

William Timmons is a conservative reformer with a small business background committed to finding solutions to everyday problems. He is honored to represent South Carolina’s 4th Congressional District in the United States Congress.

Thank you for all your support!

"The time is right to rein in runaway government spending, eliminate burdensome regulations, increase accountability and transparency for all elected officials, rebuild our military, secure our borders, and fix our broken health care system."

"As a former prosecutor and small business leader in Greenville, I have grown frustrated by the federal government’s inability to live within their means. Wasteful spending has grown out of control and needs to stop. I am equally concerned about the power of special interests in Washington, DC and support TERM LIMITS 100% giving more power back to the people and less power to the career politicians.
