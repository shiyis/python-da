Family and Work Life

Congress and the federal government must be fiscally prudent, economically inclusive, and nationally benevolent towards those in need. We need a more perfect Union, now more than ever!

Public Service across Kentucky

We the People, while loyal to our international allies and interests, must dedicate ourselves to a domestic revolution in education, a rebuilding of our economy and infrastructure, and continue to establish ample industry and innovation to employ ourselves, and the prestine natural resources, quality-of-life, and recreation to enjoy for ourselves and future Americans.

Waymen Eddings

I've served my community in many capacities over the years, humbly and with determination. As a grassroot activist, this work began in urban neighborhoods in Louisville, KY, expanded county-wide, I worked across the Commonwealth, sharing my passion for freedom, justice, and delievering these to all our neighbors and neighborhoods. Now, with your help, let's bring freedom and justice values to our entire Nation, sea to shining sea.

Waymen worked days, volunteered weekends, and studied nights to prepare his career and family to be productive citizens of our local community. Furthermore, aware of the needs of our neighbors in challenging environments, he continues to advocate for families-in-crisis and communities-in-need.

5 years of Political Involvement

After many years as a community advocate for local issues and exposure to our community leaders, Waymen is an active government appointee, political activist, and candidate for public office. Most recently, in the final months of the Bevin administration, former KY Justice and Public Safety Cabinet Secretary Tilley appointed him as a Special Assistant to the Department for Juvenile Justice. In this role, Waymen was charged with Urban Outreach and Communication, as well as, authoring a mentorship approach called Ten-4. Notably, this period coincided with the controversial county-to-state surrender of youth detention responsibilities.

10 years of Social / Entrepreneurial Leadership

Early Years

In 2018, he was commissioned as a Kentucky Colonel, the highest title of honor bestowed by the Governor of Kentucky. It is recognition of his noteworthy accomplishments and outstanding service to our state.

Yours truly,

This mission will require bold leadership and a legislative agenda that focuses daily on everyday people, if you can believe with me, we can rekindle the American dream, please consider supporting this movement.

Waymen Eddings grew up in razed housing project, Cotter Homes, the present-day revitalized neighborhood of Park duValle in the 1980's in Louisville, KY's West End. Youngest son of a single mom, his family moved to the Russell neighborhood in 1990.
