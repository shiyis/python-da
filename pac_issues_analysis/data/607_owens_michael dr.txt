In return for their service, we seek to reward fellows with an educational and networking experience that will enhance their future professional or public service careers.

• Finance and fundraising

Fellows are expected to be engaged in campaign activities at least three days a week and weekends as needed and as available. Fellows can be engaged any time during the day or evening where they can have an opportunity to learn and participate in campaign activities . Each fellow will be assigned a functional role based on their selection and fit. All fellows will be required to participate in our direct voter engagement plan as well.

Michael Owens is the only candidate that actually lives in our district that's running for Congress in this election.

If you want to vote by mail, follow these simple steps:

If you already voted early, you are still received this ballot application because when you early voted in March that was only for the presidential election. When the state postponed that election, they in effect, combined that election (the Presidential Preferential Primary) with the General Primary (where you vote for everyone else). So please, we still need you to vote in this election even if you already voted for your presidential choice.

Phone: 770-528-2581

You can trust it as much as you can in-person voting (if not more). Voting by mail (official known as absentee voting) is not new in Georgia. It's available every year to anyone who wants to use it. If you would like to have some assurance that you vote was counted, after sending the ballot in the mail, you can "track" it by checking the Georgia "My Voter Page" to see when it has arrived and been processed. See the link below.

No, everyone in Georgia has the opportunity vote by mail, but it is completely voluntary. As far as we know now, polling locations will still be open for in-person voting. This action to send every active registered voter an absentee ballot application is to encourage people to vote by mail as we all work to "flatten the curve" of the coronavirus pandemic.

The state of Georgia has purged millions of voters off the election rolls over the last several years. Check now to see if you are an active registered voter.

The state of Georgia allows anyone to vote by mail! Read the new Absentee Voting Guide to assist you with the absentee voting (vote by mail) process.

Michael Owens is the only candidate that actually lives in our district that's running for Congress in this election.

If you want to vote by mail, follow these simple steps:

If you already voted early, you are still received this ballot application because when you early voted in March that was only for the presidential election. When the state postponed that election, they in effect, combined that election (the Presidential Preferential Primary) with the General Primary (where you vote for everyone else). So please, we still need you to vote in this election even if you already voted for your presidential choice.

Phone: 770-528-2581

You can trust it as much as you can in-person voting (if not more). Voting by mail (official known as absentee voting) is not new in Georgia. It's available every year to anyone who wants to use it. If you would like to have some assurance that you vote was counted, after sending the ballot in the mail, you can "track" it by checking the Georgia "My Voter Page" to see when it has arrived and been processed. See the link below.

Jonesboro Historical Courthouse, Main Floor

In-person early voting will start on May 18th. If you are voting my mail, just follow the instructions and return the ballot after you have decided the candidates you wish to vote for. (You know what to do if you live in Georgia’s 13th.)

Email applications to absentee@cobbcounty.org as an attachment.

No, everyone in Georgia has the opportunity vote by mail, but it is completely voluntary. As far as we know now, polling locations will still be open for in-person voting. This action to send every active registered voter an absentee ballot application is to encourage people to vote by mail as we all work to "flatten the curve" of the coronavirus pandemic.
