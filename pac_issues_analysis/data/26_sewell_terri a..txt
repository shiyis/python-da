A native of Selma, Alabama, Terri is the daughter of Nancy Gardner Sewell, a high school librarian, and the late Coach Andrew A. Sewell, a math teacher and Selma High head basketball coach. Growing up, Terri went to public school in Selma. She was elected student council president, named homecoming queen, and graduated as the first black valedictorian of Selma High School.

With the help of federal student aid and academic scholarships, Terri was able to put herself through college at Princeton University, where she graduated with honors. Then she received a master’s degree in Politics with honors on scholarship from Oxford University in England and earned her law degree from Harvard Law School. While she began her legal career in New York City, it was the lure of home and family that led Terri to return to Birmingham, AL, where she became the first black woman partner at a local law office.

Terri Sewell is the proud product of Alabama’s rural Black Belt and has spent her life fighting for Alabama communities. From her time as one of the only black public finance lawyers in Alabama, when she delivered financing for new campus facilities at Alabama State University, Tuskegee University, and Stillman College, to her work as Congresswoman for Alabama’s 7th District, Terri Sewell has delivered results every step of the way.
