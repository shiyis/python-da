Congressman Garamendi: Delivering for the 3rd District

 <tag> p


Call: 916 776-1838

Those who have put service to our nation above all else deserve our respect, our thanks and our assurance that the doors to the future will be open to them. We must demand that education, job training, healthcare, and housing be readily available to these heroes. California is at a critical juncture, and the investments we make now in educating our people are key to our collective success in the years to come.

Congressman Garamendi has lived with his wife Patti on the Delta for over 30 years. This is where they raised their children and enjoy the incredible beauty and diversity of nature. Congressman Garamendi is dedicated to stopping the twin tunnel project and has introduced his own plan, a Water Plan for All of California, which would create new access to water for California through water conservation, recycling, and storage while protecting senior water rights and investing in needed levees.

Ever since Congressman Garamendi and his wife Patti embarked on a journey that would forever shape their lives – they two years they fought smallpox in rural Ethiopia as volunteers in the Peace Corps – Garamendi's perspective on foreign policy has been shaped by three primary principles.

Congressman Garamendi: Delivering for the 3rd District

As a Member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and as the Ranking Member of its Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, Garamendi is using his role to improve infrastructure in our region. Congressman Garamendi is a firm believer in investments in transportation infrastructure, creating good jobs for our neighbors and leaving lasting improvements that will help businesses throughout Northern California. We only get 92 cents back for every gas tax dollar we send to Washington, and Garamendi is fighting for a fairer share.

America must take the climate crisis seriously. Congressman Garamendi is a passionate advocate for investments in clean energy, building weatherization, public transit, and biking amenities, because these are the key ways we can lower our carbon footprint.

Congressman John Garamendi believes every American deserves the right to retire with dignity. He is resolutely opposed to all efforts to privatize Social Security, dismantle Medicare, and defund Medicaid/MediCal.

Despite being in the minority party for most of his tenure in Congress, John Garamendi has delivered a remarkable amount of tangible results for the 3rd District and for Americans across the country. Here are some highlights:

Under the Affordable Care Act, we have seen America’s uninsured rate fall to the lowest levels in U.S. history. Millions of Americans now have access to quality health care. Seniors now have access to a free annual wellness check up to identify health problems early, and the Medicare Part D prescription drug donut hole will completely close by 2020, helping seniors afford life saving medications.

CONTRIBUTE

As a rancher and pear farmer, Congressman Garamendi understands the concerns of the 3rd District’s agriculturalists. He served on the Conference Committee when Congress passed the bipartisan Farm Bill, ensuring that California’s needs were met.

Congressman John Garamendi is focused on growing the middle class. He is the leading voice in Congress for “Make It In America” policies that will help bring manufacturing jobs back to America. In Congress, he has successfully:

In America, everyone who works hard and plays by the rules deserves to pursue their American dream. We must have equal opportunity for all, do what we can to end discrimination, and remove barriers to opportunity.

John Garamendi for Congress

In the halls of Congress and throughout his career, Congressman Garamendi has been a fierce advocate for students and teachers, believing that America's prosperity depends on a well-educated workforce.

John Garamendi: Rancher, Family Man, Public Servant

Patti Garamendi: Lifelong Partner, Confidante, Trailblazer

 <tag> p


Garamendi sits on the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee as a senior member, working to ensure needed transportation and infrastructure investments to create American jobs and enhance domestic manufacturing. As a member of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) Conference Committee, Garamendi is part of a bipartisan bicameral delegation responsible for shaping the nation's water infrastructure policies. Working across the aisle with Republican lawmakers, Garamendi has helped secure levee funding for our region at the Shanghai Bend on the Feather River, the Marysville Ring Levee, and the J Levee in Hamilton City.

Elected to Congress in 2009, he seeks to address the fundamental issues that face all Americans: job creation, fixing a broken economy, access to affordable health care, protecting Social Security and Medicare, and cleaning up Wall Street.

Ms. Garamendi and her husband were just as profoundly impacted by the experience, dedicating their lives to service from that moment forward. As a couple, they lived the collaborative spirit they had instilled in their pupils, and when John was elected to the state legislature in 1974, Patti was active in analyzing, debating, and advocating for the issues at hand. Her passion for promoting economic development in California and throughout the United States never lost its global reach—a reality most notably underscored when she returned to Ethiopia in 1984 to help famine victims, and again in 1988 when she worked as part of the disaster team sent to Honduras after a hurricane devastated the country. Through these and similar efforts, she has always aimed to put America’s best face forward while demonstrating the humanity that transcends geographic and cultural differences.

As the former Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, Garamendi became a leading Democrat shaping America's port policy, a very important role for promoting exports in manufacturing and agriculture.

She also served as the U.S. Government’s National Food Security Coordinator and the Vice-Chair of the Committee on World Food Security of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). In her role as National Food Security Coordinator, Patricia worked tirelessly to promote global food security and to ensure full participation of the U.S. government and civil society in implementing the “U.S. Action Plan on Food Security.” She re-energized the work of the FSAC and rebuilt the linkages to civil society organizations both in the United States and abroad. Patricia’s most lasting achievement, however, has been to bring a human dimension to our work in food security. She shared with USDA staff the insights learned from talking directly to people living in refugee camps, to government leaders trying to promote sustainable agricultural development and to staff of nongovernmental agencies implementing food distribution programs. Her passion and commitment to achieving world food security are unparalleled.

Rare is the couple that takes a two year honeymoon, and rarer still is the couple that dedicates that honeymoon to the tireless work of fighting disease and poverty in a remote African village. The Garamendis’ first lesson to the schoolchildren they sought to help was the transformative power of collaboration, showing them how to build a bridge and effectively ingraining the idea that, if they worked together, they could accomplish anything. So profound was this lesson that, when John and Patti returned to the same Ethiopian village 46 years later, their former students remembered the message and had gone on to become leaders in their own communities.

Throughout this lifelong commitment to serving and transforming the global community, Patti has raised six children, modeling for them the importance of economic development and cross-cultural understanding and collaboration that are hallmarks of her thirty years in public service. A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley and the Humphreys School of Law, she has also served as Deputy Secretary at the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, and as Deputy Secretary at the California Technology, Trade and Commerce Agency. Her identity as a Peace Corps volunteer has never left her focus, however, leading her to help found the Joe Lurie Returned Peace Corps Volunteer Fellowship, the first scholarship available to Returned Peace Corps volunteers to pursue a Ph.D. at a California university.

Beginning his service as California’s Insurance Commissioner in 1991, Garamendi earned a reputation among state and national consumer organizations as the most effective protector of consumer interests in the nation. He successfully forced insurance companies to pay claims to policyholders, reduced homeowner, auto, and worker's compensation rates, and significantly curtailed insurance fraud.

Elected California Lieutenant Governor in 2007, he served as a UC and CSU Regent, where he fought for higher education funding and voted against every proposal to raise undergraduate tuition. As Chairman of the California Commission for Economic Development, he led successful efforts to expand workforce development and vocational education.

Patricia Garamendi later served as the Deputy Administrator for the Foreign Agricultural Service’s International Cooperation and Development (FAS/ICD) program area, where she was responsible for policy development and program administration aimed at promoting and enhancing the USDA’s involvement in cooperation and development activities worldwide. The lesson on collaboration she had taught her Ethiopian schoolchildren remained unchanged, but was now amplified globally through her efforts. While at FAS, she led the $13 million recovery program following Hurricane Mitch and helped develop the Global Food for Education Program.

PAID FOR AND AUTHORIZED BY GARAMENDI FOR CONGRESS

As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, Garamendi continues to protect and expand Travis and Beale Air Force bases which provide critical logistics and military intelligence programs that serve our nation in times of war and peace. A strong advocate for veterans, Garamendi has supported every bill in the House designed to help veterans and their families, including tax credits for employers who hire veterans and VA funding.

John Garamendi was raised on his family’s ranch in Mokelumne Hill, California. He received his B.A. in business from UC Berkeley where he was a Wheeler Scholar, second team All America offensive guard, two-time all Pacific Coast Conference team, and the 1964 West Coast heavy weight wrestling champion. He also holds an MBA from Harvard Business School. He and his wife Patti served in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia before returning to the U.S and settling down in Walnut Grove, where they raised six children. They now have 13 grandchildren and continue to raise Angus cattle on their family ranch and grow pears in their Delta orchard in Walnut Grove.

Promoting policies that create jobs in Northern California, Garamendi has become the leading advocate for the Make It In America program to strengthen manufacturing. He is the author of four Make It In America bills that require that our tax money be spent on American-made equipment and jobs. His goal is to create a pathway to the middle class for thousands of hardworking Americans. Garamendi regularly hosts local job fairs to bring employers and job seekers together.

Elected to the state legislature in 1974, Garamendi’s first legislation was the Rural Health Act of California to ensure that underserved residents in rural communities had access to quality health care. As a legislator, he established a work-oriented welfare program, developed a state agenda for economic competitiveness and scientific advancement, and authored legislation to fund the construction of research facilities across the UC system.

In 1993, Ms. Garamendi moved to Washington, DC to serve as the Associate Director of the Peace Corps, where she worked for five years and led the charge to recruit 24,000 Peace Corps volunteers in 94 countries around the world. In this capacity, she arranged the distribution of American food and aid to famine and refugee centers in war zones and developing countries, and not even an Ebola outbreak in a refugee camp in southern Sudan could deter her from her work.

In 2000, Ms. Garamendi delivered the keynote address at the Global Summit of Women Conference in South Africa, promoting the importance of women’s empowerment, broad based educational opportunities, and economic policies geared toward job creation in the developing world. Later, in 2007, she refocused her efforts on Honduras, which was now plagued by deadly floods. The Garamendis orchestrated the transfer of 40,000 pounds of rice, grown in California and donated by the Rice Farmers Cooperative, to the country, also working to rebuild villages and offer medical services.

Garamendi also serves as the Chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. In that capacity, he oversees over one-third of the Department of Defense's authorization--the largest of any Armed Services Subcommittee. He’s taken full advantage of his time as Chairman to empower our military to respond to the effects of climate change, passed legislation to provide stronger health care services to service members, and enacted a “tenants’ bill of rights” into law to provide greater legal recourse for service members who have been harmed by unhealthy conditions in privatized military housing.

With 30 years of experience in California water issues, Garamendi has become the leading advocate for a comprehenisve water plan for all California. As part of the water plan, Garamendi has developed bipartisan legislation to build Sites Reservoir, an off stream reservoir. He is a leader in the fight to stop the twin tunnels that would destroy the Delta. Instead of an expensive plumbing system that won't create a drop of new water for the state, Garamendi has called for more cost-effective investments in water recycling, conservation, and storage to help meet our water needs.

Patricia Garamendi is an active and dynamic leader in the international community, having dedicated her life and work to food security and international development efforts that began with her Peace Corps service in Ethiopia in 1966. Since that time, she has traveled from continent to continent, strategically and innovatively bringing relief, hope, and revitalization to communities ravaged by war, drought, and flood.

Today, as she helps to direct and maximize the efforts of John Garamendi’s Congressional offices representing California’s 3rd district, Ms. Garamendi is always looking for the next opportunity to promote development and propagate hope in the global communities that need it most. She sees the accomplishment of each incremental goal—like her recent efforts to bring computer access to rural impoverished communities—as another step along the road to creating the more prosperous and equal world she set her sights on as a college student all those years.

When Garamendi served as a member of the House Agricultural Committee, Garamendi helped shape a Farm Bill that gives Northern California farmers a fairer shake. He worked across the aisle to make flood insurance more affordable and has worked closely with UC Davis to bring more agricultural research to our region.

Appointed Deputy Secretary of the Interior in 1995 by President Clinton, Garamendi led the U.S. CALFED negotiating team in a process to restore the environment in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins and the Delta, while meeting the improved water availability for farmers and the region's rapidly growing cities. In what came to be known as the "Garamendi Process," city leaders, farmers, fishing interests and environmentalists systematically worked to resolve their differences and adopt mutually acceptable plans and policies to implement the Central Valley Improvement Act.

“Children are being kept out of the classroom as we enter a second school year of remote learning, and communities are struggling to provide essential services to their residents. Congress has worked in a bipartisan manner to provide relief along the way, and I was pleased to vote for the American Rescue Plan: the boldest and strongest COVID-19 relief package to-date that provides much-needed support to put vaccines in arms, put children back in school, and put Americans back to work. The legislation provides much-needed funding for my Congressional District to address our specific needs in local health care, transportation, education, and other essential services,” Garamendi continued.

Yolo County: $43,000,000

“The COVID-19 pandemic is destroying lives, small businesses, and local communities across this nation as we enter the second year of its existence,” Garamendi said. “Tragically, over 500,000 American lives have been lost to this virus, and millions more have been infected and are facing long-term health complications. The virus has also disrupted the economic livelihoods of 18 million Americans, who must now count on expanded unemployment benefits that are extended in this bill to keep food on the table.

“January 2021 saw the most COVID-19 deaths of any month since the start of the pandemic,” Garamendi continued. “There are also 9.8 million fewer jobs in the U.S. than there were right before the start of the pandemic. This aid is urgently needed to save lives, jobs, and the wellbeing of our cities, states, and citizens. I won’t rest until the ‘American Rescue Plan’ becomes law and aid is in the American people’s hands,” Garamendi concluded.

“The ‘American Rescue Plan’ also provides $1,400 in direct assistance to Americans, bringing the total—including the $600 down payment from December, 2020—to $2,000 per person. The bill also provides direct housing and nutrition assistance, extends and expands unemployment insurance to ensure Americans who have lost their job during the pandemic can afford to pay their bills, and expands the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to support small businesses and their employees,” Garamendi continued.

“I’m honored to be reappointed by my Congressional colleagues to serve as Chair of the Readiness Subcommittee,” Garamendi said. “I’m excited to build upon the progress we’ve achieved the last two years. The Readiness Subcommittee has worked tirelessly to help the military prepare for the effects of climate change and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, address contamination and health risks associated with Per- and Polyfluorinated Compounds (PFAS), support our military installations like Travis and Beale Air Force Bases in my district, and ensure service members and their families have the best on-base housing possible.

The Readiness Subcommittee oversees one-third of the Department of Defense’s budget—the largest of any subcommittee on the Armed Services Committee. The subcommittee has jurisdiction over programs related to training, logistics, equipment, maintenance, the management of over 1,100 military installations and bases worldwide, and efforts to improve energy resiliency, including climate change adaptation, and environmental health issues.

“I will remain steadfast in my determination to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the support they need to defend and serve our great nation. I look forward to achieving this goal with my new and returning colleagues on the Readiness Subcommittee,” Garamendi concluded.

“We must safeguard the Delta and the historic communities that make it such a special place. That’s why I worked with U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to designate the Delta as California’s first National Heritage Area, making up to $10 million in federal grant funding available for local projects like the proposed redevelopment of the decommissioned Rio Vista Army base. I’m pleased that the House has passed my legislation to expand the Delta National Heritage Area so this adjacent publicly owned land is eligible for federal grant funding,” Garamendi concluded.

Call: 916 776-1838

Garamendi introduced this legislation (H.R. 1230) at the request of the City of Rio Vista to expand the National Heritage Area’s boundary to include approximately 62 acres of adjacent publicly owned land encompassing: the decommissioned United States Army Reserve Center (Rio Vista), U.S. Coast Guard Station Rio Vista, Beach Drive Wastewater Treatment Plant (City of Rio Vista), and Sandy Beach County Park (Solano County).

In March 2019, Congress enacted Congressman Garamendi and U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein’s (D-CA) bicameral legislation into law designating the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as California’s first National Heritage Area to provide $10 million for community-based efforts to conserve the Delta’s cultural heritage, historic landmarks, and natural beauty.

Two of these parcels—the decommissioned United States Army Reserve Center and Beach Drive Wastewater Treatment Plant—are owned by the City of Rio Vista.

“The Delta is a crown jewel of our state and an iconic working landscape, which my family has been fortunate to call home for over 40 years,” Garamendi said. “It is the most productive watershed in the western United States and among the most ecologically important in the Western Hemisphere.

As confirmed by the National Park Service, which administers the National Heritage Area grant program, designations do not impact individual property or water rights in any way nor do they restrict local land use decisions, landownership, or hunting and fishing within the designated heritage area.

Congressman Garamendi worked with U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) since 2010 to designate the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area Act.

WASHINGTON, DC—Today, the U.S. House of Representatives passed Congressman John Garamendi’s (D-CA) legislation (H.R. 1230) that expands the boundary of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area to include approximately 62 acres of publicly owned land in unincorporated Solano County. Earlier this month, the Mayor of Rio Vista requested that Garamendi legislate this boundary adjustment to support the City’s redevelopment of the decommissioned United States Army Reserve Center (Rio Vista).

We must build surface storage such as the Sites Reservoir to increase the flexibility of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project, and invest in groundwater storage projects. The Sites Reservoir is a proposed 1.3 million acre feet off-stream reservoir in Colusa County. If Sites Reservoir has been available last winter we would have had an additional 1 million acre feet of water in storage.

Call: 916 776-1838

PAID FOR AND AUTHORIZED BY GARAMENDI FOR CONGRESS

Congressman Garamendi is dedicated to stopping the tunnels and saving the Delta. He also believes that simply saying no is not enough, and has introduced legislation that makes vital investments in water infrastructure to protect the local species and better address the ongoing drought.

The Sacramento Delta is the largest estuary in the Western United States. It is home to thriving ecosystems, rich agricultural land, and is considered to be the nexus of the California water system.

California has a long and complex water rights history starting with the Goldrush. Our water rights system is not replicated anywhere else in the country. This water rights system is crucial to Northern California Farmers, which contribute almost $3.5 billion annually to California’s economy and create 53,000 jobs. Through our water rights system, Northern California farmers are able to produce food for the world and provide a habitat for endangered salmon and over 7 million migrating waterfowl each year. Congressman Garamendi has opposed all efforts at the federal level to dismantle California’s water rights. It is vital to our local economy and ecosystems to protect California’s existing water rights system.

P.O. BOX 440, WALNUT GROVE, CA 95690 | PHONE: (916) 776-1838

For over 40 years we have ignored over 1,100 miles of Delta levees which are critical to California’s water infrastructure. Thousands of acres of some of the most fertile farmland in the country is protected by these levees, and it is vital to keep them up-to-date. Congressman Garamendi served on the bipartisan Water Resources and Development Act Conference Committee (WRDA) and worked to design a bill that authorizes flood protection projects that save lives and property and completes the much needed improvements for our Northern California's levees.

BACK TO ISSUES

Unfortunately, two massive concrete tunnels are being proposed to divert the precious Delta water supply down South. This plan wouldn't create a drop of new water for the state, would undermine senior water rights, would imperil the Delta, and would be a bad investment for the state. Instead, these tunnels would siphon water from the Delta at a rate of 15,000 cubic feet per second--a rate that would suck all of the water that runs through the Delta six months out of the year.

Education

The Latest News

 <tag> p


We must invest in education and job training for all Californians, and that includes our young men and women returning to civilian life from the armed forces. That's why Congressman Garamendi is working on reforming policies that force many veterans to seek duplicative and expensive civilian credentials for work they did while in the Air Force. Often, skills directly transfer, such as engine maintenance on an aircraft carrier, driving a truck, or serving as an emergency medical technician.

Call: 916 776-1838

By the time it expired in 1956, more than 7.8 million veterans had benefited from either a comprehensive education or training program, and nearly 2.6 million received VA-backed home loans. It was the investment that contributed significantly to the post-war economic boom and helped establish our nation's once vibrant middle class.

There is no better investment in our future. It prepares Californians for good paying jobs and pays off in increased revenues that can then be reinvested to improve the lives of all Californians as well as expand our education and vocational training system.

Those who have put service to our nation above all else deserve our respect, our thanks and our assurance that the doors to the future will be open to them. We must demand that education, job training, healthcare, and housing be readily available to these heroes. California is at a critical juncture, and the investments we make now in educating our people are key to our collective success in the years to come.

Garamendi supports an improved G.I. Bill for the 21st century. It would not match the generosity provided to the veterans of the Second World War, but would dramatically increase funding for educational benefits, including specialized trade and technical training and veterans' housing and entrepreneurial opportunities.

PAID FOR AND AUTHORIZED BY GARAMENDI FOR CONGRESS

Garamendi has been appalled by the Veterans Administration claims backlog, which has forced veterans to wait many months in a queue to learn if their medical claims will be honored. At every opportunity, Garamendi has voted to reduce the claims backlog. We're not out of the woods yet, but thanks to bipartisan support on this issue, week-by-week, the claims backlog is being reduced. It's a shameful moment in our history that we must never repeat.

BACK TO ISSUES

Imagine the positive impact that thousands of trained and educated Californians entering our workforce can have on California's fiscal future. This commitment to education and vocational training for all Californians is the real long-term solution to California's fiscal problems and must include our veterans.

CONTRIBUTE

Californians have made the most significant contribution to support both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, both in numbers and in casualties. The federal government has taken our citizens and used them, and it is now time for our president and Congress to step up and honor California's response to our nation's call.

Near the close of the Second World War, a grateful nation awarded the sacrifice of her veterans with the most comprehensive benefits package ever conceived: the Servicemembers' Readjustment Act of 1944, commonly known as the G.I. Bill. Not only did it provide full tuition and expenses to any university or college, including the Ivy League, it provided a generous living allowance.

We only get 92 cents back for every gas tax dollar we send to Washington, and Garamendi is fighting for a fairer share.

John Garamendi for Congress

You don’t need to look any further than the new Bay Bridge to understand the importance of Make It In America. The new Bay Bridge is the most expensive public project in California’s history, yet its steel was produced in China. American taxpayers had to pick up the tab while thousands of jobs were shipped overseas. Congressman Garamendi’s Make It In America agenda will eliminate the loopholes that allow corporations to outsource American manufacturing jobs. If transit agencies are going to use our federal taxpayer dollars, that money should be used to rebuild our manufacturing sector and create good American middle class jobs. It just makes sense.

Congressman Garamendi is the author of the Make It In America: Airports, Highways, Trains and Transit Act, which would create American jobs by setting stronger standards for goods and equipment purchased with federal dollars for airports, highways, trains and transit.

One of the first bills Congressman Garamendi voted for as a Member of Congress was to honor female veterans and military personnel. For 30 years Garamendi has fought for and supported the rights of women. He is the proud father of 5 daughters, and he wants to shape an America where every woman can earn equal pay for equal work.

As California's former Insurance Commissioner for eight years, Congressman Garamendi was proud to support the Patient's Bill of Rights and Affordable Care Act to help advance women's health. Because of the work of President Obama and Democrats in Congress, insurance companies can no longer deny coverage to women for the pre-existing condition of possibly getting pregnant someday. The Affordable Care Act also made preventative screenings and birth control more affordable.

When the U.S. Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2014, Garamendi immediately called on Congress to restore it. Garamendi is deeply disturbed by some efforts across the country to suppress voter turnout minority, lower income, and student communities. Policies that deeply concern Garamendi include:

Having served as Peace Corps Volunteers in Ethiopia, Congressman Garamendi and his wife Patti were distraught when war broke out between Ethiopia and its former province, Eritrea. In 1998, Garamendi organized a team of five returned volunteers, including his former Congressional Chief of Staff, and undertook a two-year mission to assist in securing peace. The team traveled to both countries to meet with the Ambassadors, Foreign Ministers and other local leaders. In the fall of 2001 they met with expatriates from both countries now living in the United States, helping them to reconcile their differences and urging them to send the message of peace to their homeland. The team was invited to the Peace Signing Ceremony in Algiers where both leaders praised the team for its pivotal role in the peace process.

Garamendi supports the Equality Act, which would update the Civil Rights Act to include LGBT Americans, specifically making it illegal to discriminate against them in the workplace, housing, and public accommodations.

Much of America’s strength lies in its diversity. We are a country that invites enterprising people from across the globe to make something of themselves in a land of opportunity. All Americans deserve the freedom to practice faith in their own way, and we should never tolerate discrimination based on religious preference.

As California’s Insurance Commissioner, Garamendi led the successful fight to end discriminatory car insurance policies that charged higher rates in communities of color. Garamendi believes that one of the greatest unresolved civil rights struggles is the fight to ensure good schools in every community in America.

In America, everyone who works hard and plays by the rules deserves to pursue their American dream. We must have equal opportunity for all, do what we can to end discrimination, and remove barriers to opportunity.

Congressman Garamendi is proud to serve in Congress with real life American heroes like Congressman John Lewis who were at the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement. Our nation has made tremendous progress in advancing the rights of African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and other minority communities, but we must remain vigilant.

Throughout our country's proud history, every generation has faced a national debate on civil rights issues. While these struggles have often been slow and arduous, as we have witnessed for more than two centuries, the trajectory of our society is toward more equality under the law. Congressman Garamendi supports full equality for the LGBT community, including marriage equality. Garamendi was proud to support an end to Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, because anyone brave enough to don the uniform of an American hero deserves to live their life openly and without fear of reprisal. Garamendi also voted for the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Act, helping to protect LGBT community and other minorities from hate-inspired violence.

Congressman Garamendi has used his position on the Armed Services Committee to fight for the vital missions at Travis and Beale. At Beale, he has worked to protect the Global Hawk and U-2 and secured funds to rebuild the base’s Civil Engineering Building. He also worked to bring the KC-135 Stratotanker to the Base, which allows Beale to dispatch 200,000 pounds of fuel for mid-air refueling missions. At Travis, he helped bring new units to the base and is working to ensure that the KC-46 will have a home at the Gateway to the Pacific.

Garamendi has consistently voted to improve pay and benefits for servicemembers, and he’s working with the Pentagon and private sector to remove duplicitous certifications that are a waste of time and money for highly skilled and well-trained servicemembers transitioning to civilian life.

Call: 916 776-1838

Garamendi also supports stopping people on terrorist watch lists from purchasing arms, particularly guns designed to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible.

America should be the world’s advocate in promoting human rights throughout the world. American benevolence can have a profound impact in regions of the world suffering from starvation and disease. We know that extremism and violence thrive in the poorest regions of the world, so this is really a national security issue too. As a proud alumnus of the Peace Corps, Garamendi supports its continued presence and expansion throughout the world, and we must work with the international community to promote fair trade and a sustainable global economy.

Ever since Congressman Garamendi and his wife Patti embarked on a journey that would forever shape their lives – they two years they fought smallpox in rural Ethiopia as volunteers in the Peace Corps – Garamendi's perspective on foreign policy has been shaped by three primary principles.

Congressman Garamendi believes targeted airstrikes against terrorist networks that pose a threat to the United States are an important part of the strategy to keep Americans safe. Working with our allies and partners in the region, we must continue to dismantle ISIL and Al Qaeda. While there is a role for intelligence and special operations, Garamendi is otherwise opposed to Americans fighting on the ground in the fight against ISIL. We should instead support our Muslim partners in the region in their campaigns against ISIL.

The United States has a productive relationship with most nations of the world. We should work with our allies and free people everywhere to promote democracy, equality, opportunity, and freedom. Promoting international gender equality is a priority of Congressman Garamendi's, because we know the oppression of women sets back liberty and makes for a more dangerous more oppressive planet. We must also work stridently to promote a free press the world over, because access to the truth is an essential first step to knowing what needs to be changed.

Mobility, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), and cyber security will only grow in importance in the decades ahead, and Travis and Beale are at the forefront of this mission. Whether it is delivering relief to Tsunami victims or monitoring Al Qaeda and ISIL movements, Travis and Beale Air Force Bases are helping the world and keeping America safe.

To ensure a reliable water supply for Northern California farmers and communities and to protect the Delta from further encroachment, Garamendi is working across the aisle to help the proposed Sites Reservoir in Colusa County clear federal hurdles. California needs more offstream water storage, and Sites is arguably the best location in the state to better prepare California for future drought and future flood years.

Stop the tunnels, save the Delta. Garamendi is especially concerned about the health of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Farmers, fishermen, and communities depend on a healthy Delta, and the $15 billion twin tunnels boondoggle would be capable of draining the Delta dry six months a year. Garamendi helped lead the fight against the peripheral canal in 1982, and he’s leading the fight against the twin tunnels today.

Garamendi has also hosted a series of events in the district focused on encouraging young women and students from disadvantaged backgrounds to pursue high paying careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Garamendi supports federal investments in STEM education.

Congressman Garamendi’s Student Loan Refinancing and Recalculating Act would lower student loan interest rates for all borrowers and save students and parents money. It would lower the current interest rate of 4.29% for undergraduate borrowers, 5.84% for graduate borrowers, and 6.84% for parent and graduate PLUS loan borrowers to 3.23% for all borrowers. Support is growing for this important legislation, with endorsements from the California State Student Association, California Democratic Party, and California Young Democrats.

"When people fall ill, we should help them get better. Most of us have experienced hard times. Many of us have gone without health coverage. When you lay all the heated rhetoric and legalese aside, the health care debate is really about what we're going to do when people get sick or injured. In America, we should take care of each other. It is irresponsible to force millions of Americans to delay treatment because they can't afford it, to live one broken leg or one chronic illness away from financial calamity."
