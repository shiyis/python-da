Through his work with the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, Dan successfully fought for House rules changes to open up the legislative process to rank-and-file members and make lawmaking less top-down driven and more representative of the American people.

Dan is a leader in the fight to contain the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs and this year introduced legislation to lower the cost of life-sustaining drugs for seniors and others on Medicare by allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to leverage the purchasing power of the federal government along with prescription drug pricing data from other developed nations to ensure patients receive better pricing.

Dan helped introduce the first bipartisan climate change bill to institute a fee on carbon emissions and this year sponsored the bipartisan Raise Wages, Cut Carbon Act, which returns all the revenue generated from fees on greenhouse gas emissions to the American people.

Dan authored the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act, which required the establishment of a comprehensive manufacturing strategy for the first time since Alexander Hamilton.

When the EPA released a study in 2018 showing a significantly increased cancer risk in the western suburbs because of ethylene oxide (EtO) emissions from Sterigenics, Dan immediately called for a shutdown and introduced the Clean Up EtO Act to force the strengthening of EtO emission standards

Now in his eighth term, Dan has authored more 20 laws including initiatives that boost American manufacturing jobs, protect the environment and fight climate change, empower victims of sexual assault, spur American technological innovation, honor veterans, and safeguard consumers.

As Chair of the House Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials, Dan got a provision inserted in a transportation funding bill that directs the Federal Railroad Administration to identify potential issues contributing to the frequency and length of delays on Metra trains, and develop recommendations on addressing these challenges.
