VII. Invest in Gun Violence Research and Community-Centered Health Care

Mass shootings are an almost daily occurrence in the United States. Things are so bad that from 2013 to 2019, there was exactly one week in which the United States did not suffer from a mass shooting. Some of the deadliest have been at American schools. On April 20, 1999, gunmen murdered twelve students and a teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado. A few years later, seven people were shot to death at Red Lake High School. Five girls were killed at West Nickel Mines School. Thirty-two people were murdered at Virginia Tech University, five at Northern Illinois University, seven at Oikos University, twenty-six at Sandy Hook Elementary, five at Santa Monica College, four at Marysville Pilchuck High School, nine at Umpqua Community College, seventeen at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and ten at Santa Fe High School. The common denominator: guns. As I have said since the start of this campaign, I will do my damnedest to put an end to mass shootings.

Purchasing a deadly weapon in the United States is far too easy. You can buy a gun from a storefront dealer who only sells firearms and ammunition. You can buy a gun from a dealer who operates out of their home. You can buy a gun at a gun show. You can buy a gun from a private seller. Sometimes federal law requires you to undergo a background check. Sometimes it does not. When it comes to ammunition, there are even more purchase options and buyers never have to go through a background check. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives engages in very little oversight of firearms sales, and federal law prohibits ATF from modernizing many of its records. Perhaps most egregiously, federal law does not prohibit people like the Las Vegas mass murderer from stockpiling an arsenal of weapons and ammunition. In fact, the Las Vegas shooter was able to lawfully purchase 33 rifles and hoard more 1,600 rounds of ammunition in the 12 months before he killed 58 people and shot another 500. Our laws—or the lack thereof—are killing thousands of Americans, and an NRA-backed federal law makes it virtually impossible to sue gun manufacturers. The United States must secure all sales of firearms and ammunition.

V. Mitigate and Prevent Mass Shootings

The United States is facing a public health crisis like no other: premature deaths from gun violence. At the same time, we are home to the world’s foremost public health organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nevertheless, since the mid-1990s, the NRA and its cronies in Congress have virtually halted all CDC research into gun violence and gun violence prevention. Meanwhile, more than 100,000 people are shot in the United States each year. More than a third of them die from a gunshot wound. Public health experts have called for a public health approach to ending gun violence. That includes research at the CDC and National Institutes of Health, which is also suffering under the chilling effects of government limitations. Ending gun violence requires a plan that provides sustained funding for public health research and includes community-centered health care, wraparound services, and community planning to improve lives.

IV. Protect Victims of Domestic Violence

III. Tackle America’s Firearm Suicide Epidemic

Each year in the United States, more than 100,000 people are shot, and more than a third of them die. The fact of the matter is that the United States has a gun problem. The only way to tackle this epidemic is with a comprehensive plan and a President who puts gun violence at the top of the agenda. My plan to end gun violence would bring the full force of the presidency to bear on the issue. That means working with Congress to pass new laws. It means spending money. It means putting the Department of Justice to work fighting special interests in the courts. It means executive action. And it means using the President’s bully pulpit to spur states into action. Nothing less will do.

VI. Secure All Sales of Firearms and Ammunition

We will never end gun violence if we do not invest in hope. The truth of the matter is that the communities most impacted by gun violence—communities of color and people who live in poverty, especially in America’s urban areas—also have suffered from decades of divestment. We have neglected communities of color, and we have failed to invest in young Black men across the country. In 2012, 90 people were killed in mass shootings like the tragedies at Sandy Hook and Aurora. That same year, around 6,000 Black men and children died from gun homicide. Young Black men shot down in Flint, Baltimore, Newark, Baton Rouge, and in neighborhoods across this country cannot be forgotten. We are failing as a society to preserve Black lives or to even reflect on the loss of Black lives to gun violence. To end gun violence, we must drastically improve the social and economic factors that have fed cycles of violence for far too long. Government has failed to invest in the long-term wellbeing of poverty-stricken neighborhoods and communities of color. Victims of gun violence and community leaders who are on the front lines fighting for their neighborhoods recognize that by the time someone picks up a gun, layers upon layers of systemic injustice have already failed them. Ending gun violence means investing in more community-oriented police officers than patrol officers. It means investing in hope to prevent people from picking up a gun in the first place.

II. Invest in Hope for Our Neighborhoods

Desperation is destroying America’s families. Suicide rates have gone up everywhere we look, and the trend has been especially dramatic among men and children. Every single day in this country, around 59 people die from suicide. Those are 22,000 Americans who die each year. A disproportionate number of them are middle-aged men and senior citizens, but over the past ten years, firearm suicide has risen more than 60 percent among children and teenagers. One thing is true across all victim demographics: Our country’s suicide problem is a gun problem. That is because suicide attempts are often impulsive—7 out of 10 people who attempt suicide do so within an hour of deciding to end their life—and guns are made to kill. It follows that in places where guns are more readily available, suicide deaths are more common. The fact of the matter is that a person who has easy access to firearms during a suicide crisis is far more likely to die than someone who does not have access to a firearm. We need to reduce firearm suicides.

PAID FOR BY SWALWELL FOR CONGRESS

Here’s how:

I. Ban and Buy Back Semiautomatic Assault Weapons

Semiautomatic assault weapons were made for the military and police. They are weapons built for carnage. They are powerful enough to blow through bulletproof vests and usually have large-capacity magazines that can be quickly replaced. That is why they are often the weapon of choice for mass murderers, and that is why they need to be banned in the United States for civilians outside shooting ranges and hunting clubs. A ban-and-buy-back plan is an investment in the right to live.

No woman, no child, no person should have to fear that their abuser has a gun. Too often, however, their abusers do have access to firearms. That must end. Guns are a major driver of domestic violence in the United States. Our country is the most dangerous high-income country for violence against women. A third of American women will experience some form of intimate partner violence in their lifetime. More than two-thirds of battered women report having guns used against them. And somewhere between 14 and 20 percent of women lost to homicide are killed by an intimate partner. American gun policy has failed women, and we have to fix it. Reducing gun violence against women starts with getting guns out of the hands of dangerous people.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission exists to help ensure consumers are not put into unnecessary danger by the products the purchase. Some products need warning labels. Some products need recalls because they are defective. Some products need new safety features. But all products need oversight. From the 1950s to 1970s, at family gatherings across the country, parents and children played lawn darts. The objective of the game was to throw giant darts into plastic hoops in the grass. The problem was that the lawn darts themselves—oversized darts tipped by metal or plastic spears—could puncture skulls. At least three children were killed before the CPSC banned the sale of lawn darts in the United States in 1988. To truly improve public safety, we need gun violence reform that starts at the gun and ammunition factories.

VIII. Regulate Manufacturers

No plan to curb gun violence in the United States is complete if it fails to recognize that not all gun violence is the same. On an average day in the United States, suicides and criminal homicides claim nearly as many lives as we lost to mass shootings in 2017, which was the deadliest year on record for mass shootings in this country. Ending gun violence in the United States requires a comprehensive approach that starts in manufacturing facilities and does not end until every community in the United States is safe. I will fight like hell to give people a reason to live, foster a culture of hope in every neighborhood, regulate firearms and ammunition to protect communities and police officers, and ban semiautomatic assault weapons.

My Capitol Hill internship coincided with the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, cementing my resolve to enter public service and inspiring my first legislative achievement: creating a public-private college scholarship program for students who lost parents in the attacks. After earning a law degree, working as a county prosecutor, and serving on the Dublin City Council, I won my first House term in 2012 by defeating a 40-year incumbent.

When House Democrats staged a 25-hour sit-in to protest inaction on gun-violence legislation in June 2016, I was first to start live-streaming the protest from my phone after the House Chamber’s cameras were cut off. When it became clear that Russia interfered in 2016’s election, I co-authored the first legislation calling for creation of an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the meddling and make recommendations to ensure it never happens again.

For the last six years, I’ve represented California’s 15th Congressional District, including much of the eastern San Francisco Bay Area. My dad was a cop, and my mom made wedding cakes and dollhouses to help make ends meet. Our family moved around and eventually settled in Dublin, Calif. Thanks to my parents’ hard work, and to my own decent soccer abilities, I earned a Division 1 soccer scholarship to become the first in my family to attend college.

In April 2015, I founded Future Forum: a group of young Democratic Members of Congress, now numbering almost 50, focused on issues of key importance to millennials including college affordability and student loan debt; jobs and economic opportunity; home ownership; and climate change. As chairman, I visited almost 50 U.S. cities to listen to thousands of young Americans and bring their ideas back to Washington to guide policy.

I served on the Homeland Security Committee – championing causes such as aviation security – before being appointed to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. With on-the-ground experience of visits to Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Turkey, Russia, South Korea, and other nations, and with regular briefings on the threats facing America, I’m well-versed in the threats that face our nation and how to protect us.

Are you ready to go big, be bold and do good with me?

I also serve on the Judiciary Committee, where I use my experience as a prosecutor and as a son and brother of law enforcement officers. On that committee, I also deal with issues including voting rights, LGBT equality, comprehensive immigration reform, and protecting a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions.

I’m a Democrat, no doubt about it. But I’ve deliberately charted a bipartisan course – and not just because I’m the son of two Republicans. In my first term, I co-founded the United Solutions Caucus composed of freshman from both sides of the aisle.

As co-chairman of the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, I’ve helped set the caucus’ policy agenda and oversee committee assignments. As founder and chairman emeritus of Future Forum, I’ve been House Democrats’ point man on outreach to millennials – the nation’s biggest, most diverse and best-educated generation. As Chairman of the Intelligence Modernization and Readiness Subcommittee of the House Intelligence Committee, I’ve helped keep our nation safe. And as a Judiciary Committee member, I’ve stood up and spoken out for upholding the rule of law and equality for all.

My most important roles are husband to Brittany and dad to Nelson and Kathryn (a.k.a. Cricket). I’m in this for them, and for your kids too.
