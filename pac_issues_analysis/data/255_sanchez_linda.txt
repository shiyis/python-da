La congresista Linda Sánchez afirma que luchara porque el plan incluya la reunificación familiar.

Paid for by Stand with Sanchez

Linda Sánchez, legisladora demócrata que representa al Distrito 38 de California, e integrante del Comité Judicial del Congreso, clave en el debate de la reforma migratoria, no parece optimista con la presentación de los principios republicanos y sostiene que los proyectos de ley que avanzarán serán restrictivos.

On Tuesday night during his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama will announce an executive order increasing the minimum wage for federal contract workers from $7.25 to $10.10.

En entrevista con La Opinión, Sánchez aseguró que el Caucus Hispano en el Congreso defenderá la legalización de indocumentados con un camino a la ciudadanía, y que el Presidente Barack Obama se ha comprometido con éste a no aceptar un proyecto de ley de reforma migratoria que no haya sido apoyado por el liderazgo hispano. En lo particular, Sánchez asegura que luchará por la protección de la reunificación familiar de los inmigrantes.

Congresswoman Linda Sanchez, D-Cerritos, has introduced a bill that would end a policy denying Social Security benefits to same-sex couples.

Linda was born in the City of Orange to immigrant parents from Mexico. Her father worked as an industrial mechanic and her mother was an elementary school teacher. From her parents, Linda learned dedication, gratitude, hard work, and commitment to community. She graduated from UC Berkeley and earned a law degree from UCLA.

Ensuring that the U.S. remains competitive in the global economy is also a top priority for Linda. She is fighting to level the playing field for American workers, bring jobs back from overseas and pushing for policies that ensure our international trade agreements provide economic and employment opportunities for U.S. companies and workers.

In Congress, Linda serves on the prestigious House Committee on Ways and Means where she works on tax, trade, retirement security, and healthcare issues. She is working to reform our tax code so that it is simple, fair, and provides certainty to working families and small businesses.

Congresswoman Linda Sánchez has dedicated her life to improving the lives of families in our community, and making Southern California a better place to live and work for everyone.

Linda is recognized by her colleagues in Congress for her ability to handle any challenge. That is why House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi tapped Linda to lead the Ethics Committee and serve on the Select Committee on Benghazi. As Ranking Member on the Ethics Committee, Linda is committed to ensuring that the American people can have confidence in their elected leaders and those who break the rules are held accountable. She has worked hard to ensure the Benghazi Committee lives up to it's responsibility, to the American people and the families of the victims, to carefully analyze the facts and make recommendations to protect the lives of our diplomats serving overseas.

She is married to Jim Sullivan and is the proud mother of Joaquin Sánchez Sullivan. Joaquín and his three Sullivan brothers Brendan, Jack and Seamus can often be found playing with Brooklyn and Scully, the family’s miniature Schnauzers.
