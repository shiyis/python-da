News: Dr. Richard Thripp was elected Chair of the Volusia County Democratic Party on December 8th, 2020. Our Campaign Manager, Emily Humphrey, was elected Secretary, and many other campaign volunteers have taken on leadership positions to help Democrats win in 2022 in Volusia County and in Florida statewide and multi-county races!

Please follow me on Twitter and like/follow the Volusia County Democratic Party on Facebook and Twitter to stay up-to-date.

The people of Florida are tired of being ignored by their politicians. “Business as usual” is not enough anymore. We need change. We need higher wages. We need more jobs. We need stronger protections and better benefits. I’m Richard Thripp, and I believe the working people of Florida deserve more from their federal government.

We lost the August 18th, 2020 Democratic primary for Florida’s 6th congressional district by 3%. We are very sad, but this was a strong showing for a first-time candidate. We are proud of the 28,661 votes we received and your support! We will be continuing our work toward Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, universal basic income, and more under President Biden and our Democratic majorities in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, and we will continue our advocacy at the state and local levels.
