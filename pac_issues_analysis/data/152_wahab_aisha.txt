City Council Budget Committee Member (1 of 3 Councilmembers who have input on all things housing)

Introduced request to accelerate minimum wage to account for the high cost of living in the region.

CSU EAST BAY - MBA

We did a lot of good! We may have ruffled some feathers along the way but we accomplished more than what anyone said was possible.

Much More in Action:

Pushed for the creation of a safety plan for natural disasters and the assessment of community resources in the wake of the shootings at the New Zealand mosque and Poway, CA synagogue.

Environmental Planning for Development:

Distributed close to 16,000 respiratory masks to Hayward residents during the deadly 2018 fire season.

Read more below about what we accomplished.

Aisha Wahab is a community leader committed to ensuring equal access to opportunity. She was the first Afghan-American woman to be elected to public office in the United States after receiving the highest number of votes to become a member of the Hayward City Council. She is currently the City of Hayward’s Mayor Pro Tempore (or Vice Mayor). She has served as an advocate for seniors, immigrant communities, and women. Her leadership in the nonprofit and international relations community includes addressing issues such as affordable housing, civic engagement, education, and access to opportunity. Her professional experience as a businesswoman in the tech industry includes overseeing contracts with many technology companies including Amazon, Adobe, and Microsoft.

One new voice was all that was needed to provide tenant protections, expand rent control and affordable housing options, push for better business practices and strategic spending, require mental health and de-escalation training for public safety officials, and partner with our local schools and cities on a variety of issues.

Independent Investigation On Officer Involved Deadly Use of Force

Voted to make A Street & B Street a priority and two-ways. (I’d prefer B St. become a shopping hub with some other adjustments)

New Housing Programs:

City now has a 1-time fund policy where for all 1-time funds are divided 50/50. 50% focused on paying into our General Reserves and Unfunded Liabilities, the other 50% to Economic Development & Emerging Needs

Reduce buffer zones for commercial cannabis (needs to be overhauled completely)

Promise Kept By Things I’ve Done:

Thank you for taking a chance on me and allowing me to serve the community.

Before she could tie her own shoes, Aisha was placed in foster care after her parents passed away. She was born in New York City and grew up in the Bay Area. Her experience as a foster child led to a deep understanding of the challenges and struggle for the opportunity that many face and drove her commitment to community service as an adult. Aisha and her sister were adopted together by a young self-employed couple who taught them the value of hard work, perseverance, and a strong sense of pride as an American with great respect for their Afghan heritage.

We have another 2 years to accomplish much more.

Supported a “Dig-Once” Policy to install underground conduits for 21st century technology

Start Phase I and II of the Hayward Youth & Family Center

2019 - East Bay Young Democrats - Local Legislator of the Year

Included Environmental Considerations for Parcel 5 and 6

Aisha has served as the Alameda County Chair of the Human Relations Commission and served as a Board Member for the non-profit Afghan Coalition, Abode Services, and Tri-City Volunteers. Aisha has served as a Community Organizer to ensure housing for low and extremely low-income individuals, provide seniors with programs to help them remain active, educate immigrants to become more civically engaged, and support women. She also previously served on the Alameda County Public Health Commission. Aisha has organized around these issues and others including education, protecting the environment, encouraging civic engagement, and women's rights. She also served as an Organizer and Speaker at the Women’s March Bay Area San Jose.

Together, we can do anything.
