Together, we can create a North Carolina that works for everyone.

Working people across North Carolina and across America are struggling. They deserve representatives who will offer up policies, not platitudes, and fight for an agenda bold enough and big enough to lift them up. I’ve lived that struggle and I know what a difference it could make to so many if we re-engineered our government to work for the people. Policy is personal to me and that’s why I’ll fight tirelessly to deliver real solutions to the very real problems that real people are facing.

Growing up, Erica saw and felt the racism and injustice of the American education system; she kept asking herself why some had access to resources while so many others didn’t. In college, she started organizing to do something about it, and worked with other students on campus to fight for progress. During an internship with Boeing, she fought to standardize the pay scale, to ensure engineering students were paid equally for equal work, no matter the color of their skin or their gender. When she went out into the world, she understood the grotesque inequality, racism, and sexism that people experience every single day, because she had too.

Now, Erica’s running for U.S. Senate because she believes it’s time for government to work for all of us, instead of just the wealthy and well-connected. Erica believes that a government which can afford billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy should also be able to afford $2,000 monthly checks for struggling Americans in the middle of a pandemic. She knows we need Medicare for All to end the days when a family goes bankrupt because someone got sick, and believes we must combat the climate crisis by creating millions of new jobs building the energy system of the future. And Erica isn’t taking a dime from corporate PAC’s or fossil fuel companies, because she believes North Carolinians deserves a Senator who works for us, not massive corporations and CEO’s.

That’s what drove Erica to public service — first in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, then as a teacher, then as a minister, and finally as an elected official serving North Carolinians in the State Senate. As a legislator, Erica’s entire career has been about fighting injustice, whether it was corporations who were dumping toxic PCB’s in Warren County, or payday lenders trying to make a quick buck at the expense of working people.

Erica Smith has spent her whole life fighting to make life better for North Carolinians. Born at Fort Bragg and raised in Northampton County by parents who didn’t graduate from college, Erica Smith’s life hasn’t been like other politicians. Every summer, she picked cucumbers and harvested corn from her family’s farm and her dream was to one day have a job inside with air conditioning. Early on, Erica’s parents taught her the transformative power of education so she worked hard in school and got a scholarship to North Carolina A&T where she studied engineering.

I know what it means to struggle. I know what it means to fight the kind of fight that so many families across North Carolina are fighting today.
