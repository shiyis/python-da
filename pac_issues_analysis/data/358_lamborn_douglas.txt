I am honored to represent the people of Colorado's Fifth Congressional District at our nation's capital.

- Congressman Doug Lamborn

In my position as a Ranking Member on the House Armed Services Committee, I will advocate to fully fund our national defense budget and fortify our national security through amendments in the upcoming FY22 NDAA. During my time in Congress, I have delivered nearly $3 billion in funds to the Pikes Peak region for new military construction and other much-needed projects for our troops. I plan to continue to be a strong advocate for the needs of our brave men and women in uniform, as well as our veterans.

In the 117th Congress, I will prioritize working across the aisle with my colleagues in Colorado's delegation to overturn the terrible basing decision for Space Command's headquarters, returning it to its rightful home of Colorado Springs.

I will continue my fight to protect our traditional family values and the sanctity of life. My first bill introduced for the 117th Congress, the Second Chance at Life Act, would require abortion facilities to provide women seeking chemical abortions information about reversing the procedure's effects, saving thousands of innocent lives.

Additionally, I will push for meaningful legislation that strengthens our economy and ease regulations on small businesses, which are our country's backbone. Business owners are doing their best to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. I believe that big government should get out of their way, allow them to open their doors, serve their patrons safely, and get this economy moving again.

Lastly, as a senior member of the House Natural Resources Committee, I will push to end the Biden Administration's moratorium ban on new oil and gas leases and other anti-energy policies that would put Americans with high paying jobs out of work. These burdensome policies will hurt American families with higher energy prices during a time when they are recovering from a pandemic. We should promote an all-of-the-above energy policy that ensures affordable, domestically produced energy, and security, for all Americans.

Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same. ~ Ronald Reagan

We appreciate the knowledgeable positions Congressman Lamborn has taken and his recognition of the importance of maintaining and growing this close relationship between the USA and Israel. We look forward to working together with Congressman Doug Lamborn in the 117th US Congress.

We are incredibly thrilled that Congressman Doug Lamborn was victorious in his race for the US House of Representatives in Colorado. Our PAC was privileged to have the opportunity to endorse and financially support Congressman Lamborn’s candidacy. Our PAC’s mission is dedicated to strengthening, promoting, and enhancing the important relationship between our country and Israel. In our opinion this is clearly in the best interest of the United States for military, strategic, and economic reasons.

The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), the nation's largest nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to eliminating waste, fraud abuse, and mismanagement in government, released its 2019 Congressional Ratings.

"We applaud Rep. Lamborn for his tireless work on behalf of the taxpayers while serving in Congress. His courageous votes to cut wasteful spending and make government more accountable should serve as an example to other members, challenging them to keep their promises to protect the fiscal interests of American taxpayers. We have no doubt that he will continue to help lead the effort to eradicate wasteful spending and bring fiscal sanity to Washington. His constituents should be very proud of him." - Tom Schatz, the President of the CCAGW

“Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost.” “The liberty of the press is essential to the security of the state.” “If all printers were determined not to print anything till they were sure it would offend nobody, there would be very little printed.” ~ Thomas Jefferson

Throughout his tenure, Congressman Lamborn has been an outspoken leader for smaller government, lower taxes, pro-family issues and a robust national defense. It is only natural that he be involved in such conservative caucus’ as the Republican Study Committee, and the Constitution Caucus. In addition, Congressman Lamborn is co-founder of the Missile Defense Caucus and founder of the Sovereignty Caucus. He is also co-chair of the Republican Israeli and Israel Allies Caucus.

A secure America means reforming the two-thirds of our budget that goes to entitlement spending. In a perfect world, churches and non-profits would carry the burden of caring for the less fortunate members of society. But, until that day comes, government programs must work and must be purged of their waste, fraud, and abuse.

Congressman Lamborn received his bachelor’s degree in journalism and his law degree from the University of Kansas where he was a National Merit Scholar.

I will continue to fight for conservative, constitutional, and traditional values. I will work hard for the people of the Fifth Congressional District, for our men and women in uniform, and for a bright and prosperous future for America.

A strong America means that we fully fund our military to face the threats of a dangerous world. It means making sure that America is respected and taken seriously by other nations. It means having a foreign policy where we support our friends over our enemies, and not the other way around. I believe, like Ronald Reagan, that we achieve peace through strength.

Congressman Doug Lamborn

Congressman Lamborn serves as a high ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee. He is ranking member of the Subcommittee on Readiness. This subcommittee has jurisdiction over all military readiness, which consists of operations and maintenance, training, military construction, civilian and contract workforce, military installations, property management, family housing, energy, and base realignment and closures. Congressman Lamborn also serves on the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee. This subcommittee has jurisdiction over the procurement of all ground vehicles and nonstrategic aircraft for all of the services.

Colorado has been home for the Lamborn family for over 30+ years. Congressman Lamborn is married to Jeanie, his wife of 43 years. Together they have five children, two daughter-in-laws, one son-in-law and four grandchildren.

Before being elected to Congress, Congressman Lamborn served in the Colorado House from 1995 to 1998, where he was elected Republican Whip in 1997. In 1998 he was elected to the Colorado State Senate where he served for nine years. During his tenure Lamborn was elected President Pro-tem by his colleagues. He also served as Chairman of the State, Veterans, and Military Affairs Committee and was Republican Caucus Chairman. Congressman Lamborn also served on the Appropriations Committee in both the House and Senate for a total of nine years. Congressman Lamborn feels his greatest achievement while serving in Denver was to sponsor and pass the largest tax cut in the history of Colorado.

Congressman Lamborn is also a member of the House Committee on Natural Resources. He serves on the Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee. This subcommittee monitors energy development on our public lands. He also serves on the Water, Oceans, and Wildlife subcommittee. This subcommittee oversees the protection of water supplies, coastlines, oceans, and marine wildlife.

A prosperous America means utilizing American energy to create American jobs and lower energy bills for consumers. A prosperous America means having fewer regulations blocking the creativity of our entrepreneurs and job creators. A prosperous America cannot be one that includes the disaster that is Obamacare. Until it is replaced with conservative, free-market solutions, it will continue to cripple job growth, stifle economic progress, and be an enemy of individual prosperity.

Congressman Doug Lamborn is serving in Congress after being elected in 2006 to serve the Colorado 5th Congressional District. During his tenure, Congressman Lamborn has proven himself as a strong voice for the conservative values of his district. He is an advocate of the free market, has never voted for a bailout, and has never voted for a tax increase. As a champion for individual liberty, Lamborn voted against Obamacare and supports its repeal. He is a rock solid defender of the 2nd amendment. Congressman Lamborn joined his colleagues in filing an amicus brief in support of the Landmark Supreme Court Heller Decision case which defines 2nd amendment rights as rights belonging to individuals

Yours truly,

A free America is a country that protects Constitutional rights, especially the Second Amendment and freedom of religion for civilians and members of the armed forces. A free America simplifies our tax code to reduce and eliminate the role of the IRS. A free America does not have an Imperial President who ignores the co-equal branches of government.
