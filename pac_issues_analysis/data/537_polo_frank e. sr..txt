Kneeling Only Before God.

HEALTHCARE April 17, 2021 There is no question in Frank Polo’s mind that reform is necessary for the healthcare sector. Nevertheless, we must understand that free healthcare without a tax increase is not possible. Therefore, the need for a balanced approach.

OPPORTUNITY FOR THE YOUTH April 17, 2021 Our youth are very in constant need of guidance, and our politicians, and society as a whole, have forgotten about them. I will encourage the creation of programs focused on helping our youth. Those programs will make our youth more productive, and they will receive the necessary on-the-Job Training to be ready to enter the workforce.

ECONOMY AND JOB CREATION April 17, 2021 Policies like taxing the rich, wasteful government expenditure, and big government are policies that do not help our economy. We must create good paying jobs, and opportunities for the youth.
