The other, is based on the premise that government is our servant. This group, of which I consider myself a member, believes America is an exceptional nation in the history of the world; that its citizens are good hearted, and have shown an extraordinary ability to adapt & overcome any obstacle placed before them. That free-market capitalism has and continues to be the best method of lifting people out of poverty and driving the innovation, that benefits the world as a whole. We believe Liberty is freedom tempered by morality; Justice should be the ultimate goal of the law; and that Equality means applying the law equally to all. Not dividing our citizens into group and giving some special rights in attempt to achieve equality. We believe America has sometimes struggled, but that these Ideals are something we have continually worked toward trying to achieve.

There are currently two different groups with two different political ideologies vying for control of America & its citizens. The first is based on the premise that government is our master. This group despises the founding principles of this Nation, believes free-market capitalism is the root of the worlds problems, and that America’s citizens are ignorant & cannot survive without the government constantly overseeing their lives. They find it acceptable to use any means necessary to silence the free speech of those they disagree with, celebrate laws stating it is lawful for a baby born alive because of a botched abortion to be murdered, and do not distance themselves from those who use physical violence, against someone for wearing the wrong hat, or eating in the wrong restaurant.

History has shown us many times where these two paths lead; and I am running to be your IA-01 Representative to Congress because of my convictions to see that Our Nation follows the latter path into the future. As to prevent America from taking anymore misguided footsteps down the former.

There is nothing that so lifts the human spirit, as success through one’s own efforts. That's the Iowa grit, I will bring to Washington D.C. (@Hansen4Congress)

Whether as an engineer out in Las Vegas, a small business owner, 30 years as Hansen Refrigeration, or cattle rancher at Rock Cedar Ranch for 25 years with Jeanett selling beef to local area restaurants & to customers; I have worked with my hands & used the knowledge I have gained over the years. To solve whatever problems have arisen for both my family & my customers, I will continue to do so in Washington, D.C. as your IA-01 Representative to Congress.

The government does not have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem. I support the continued effort to simplify and reduces taxes as a means to stimulate the economy. I am also a proponent of freezing any increases in spending and reducing the budget by one cent of every dollar every year for the next ten year as a means to eliminate waste, make government more efficient and reduce the debt.

The Republican belief is that everyone, through the use of their education, skills and personal fortitude should have the opportunity to climb the social-economic ladder as far as they wish. Education is the key to this journey. Our educational system should not be a cookie-cutter design preparing everyone for the same road in life. It should take into consideration the individual talents of students and prepare them for the road that best suits them in life. We also need to stop just throwing money at failing school systems and look at alternatives solutions.

There are only two ways to enter the United States, lawfully or illegally, period. The wall must be built to control illegal immigration, drug and child trafficking. I support the President’s call for the end to the visa lottery system and chain migration; more officers to patrol the border and more judges to handle asylum claims and a permanent solution to the DACA problem which may include a very long path to citizenship once a list of requirements is met.

Security is the number one job of the government and peace is only achieved through strength. We must also take care of those who have sacrificed so that the rest of us may live in that security and peace.

Whether as an engineer out in Las Vegas, a small business owner, 30 years as Hansen Refrigeration, or cattle rancher, Rock Cedar Ranch, 25 years with Jeanett selling beef to local area restaurants and customers, I have worked with my hands and used the knowledge I have gained over the years to solve whatever problems have arisen for both my family and my customers and will continue to do so in Washington, D.C. if elected.

As an EMT, I was taught that life ended when the heart ceased to beat, no matter the condition of the body or the environment it was in. If life is the opposite of death, then its definition must also be the opposite, that is life begins when the heart starts to beat, no matter the condition of the body or the environment which it is in. We must also be truthful about the entire eugenics movement, from its start by Democrats in their effort to remove the “weeds” from the garden of humanity to its role in the destruction of the family unit, especially among the minority community and the disastrous negative effects resulting from it.

My family has been without health insurance for over 20 years, so I understand this problem inside and out as well as the solutions to it which include making health insurance companies play by the same rules as other types of insurance; making hospitals charge actual pricing for their service and doing it in a transparent way; simplifying regulations and reducing administrative costs; expansion and portability of health saving accounts; and people using health insurance for its intended purpose, that being protecting individuals from bankruptcy in the event of a major medical incident by providing low cost catastrophic policies. Yes, this means assuming more personal responsibility for our health which is something we need to do as diseases related to obesity are the number one cause death in America.

Agriculture has and always will be a big part of Iowa’s economy. It has gone through many advancements, struggles, and changes over the last couple of centuries. Agriculture is now at a crossroads that will determine whether the number of people responsible for raising the world’s food continues to age and decline. As operations are consolidated into fewer hands, which is actually a nationally security issue; or whether we listen to the people and implement programs that assist in putting younger farmers back on the land. We must revitalize our rural communities. Everyone seems to agree that we need to address this problem, but then keeps pushing policies that only exasperate it. Here is a more in depth look at the problem and a different kind of solution to it.

This is a real simple one for me; especially since I have a 23 year span of writings to back it up. The Second Amendment gives individuals citizens the right to purchase, own and use firearms to defend themselves, their family, their friends, their neighbors and America against anyone looking to do us harm. I have gone through back ground checks when both purchasing firearms from dealer and at gun shows. It is a simple process and I have nothing against them as long as the government is not retaining any records. Any other place or reason, they are unnecessary. Reciprocal concealed laws, stand your ground laws and trained armed teachers in schools, all great ideas.

I was born in Suffolk County, Long Island, New York, the heart of George Washington’s spy ring during the Revolutionary War. My elementary years were spent on field trips to battle sites in the area and the first book I ordered from the Scholastic Book Club was ‘The Life and Times of George Washington’. This is what sparked my passion for America and for literally the last 50 years I have read, studied, written and spoke about the foundational principles upon which this Nation was founded, the people who did it, the teachers from who they learned and how we have continually worked towards fulfilling the Ideals of Liberty, Justice and Equality that has made America an exceptional chapter in the history of mankind.

My adolescent years were spent in what is now Las Vegas, Nevada. Then it was desert and a place where we hauled in our own water and put up our own power poles to get electricity to our mobile home. The first job in the morning was to go sweep the rattlesnakes off the concrete slab where we were building our new house. At that time, when we went to town, it was not uncommon to see individuals in the supermarket, restaurants and even the banks walking around with their sidearm strapped to their hip. It was in this environment that I learned about responsibility and the duty of citizens to stand up for their Rights.

Whether as an engineer out in Las Vegas, a small business owner, 30 years as Hansen Refrigeration, or cattle rancher, Rock Cedar Ranch, 25 years with Jeanett selling beef to local area restaurants and customers, I have worked with my hands and used the knowledge I have gained over the years to solve whatever problems have arisen for both my family and my customers and will continue to do so in Washington, D.C. as your IA-01 Representative.

My wife has been a butcher for some 40 years now and yes, she in the brains behind Rock Cedar Ranch beef, I get to feed and clean up after the cattle and fix fence. We have one daughter, Addie Rose, who inherited her Mom’s huge heart, her Dad’s tenacity and the work ethic Iowans are famous for, and who is a registered nurse that cares for cancer patients. Family is a blessing that should never be taken for granted and it is the duty of every elected official to see that their constituents’ families are safe, secure and have the opportunity for a good life.

In August, 1987, out in Las Vegas, the intern minister and his wife, living in the apartment above mine, were moving back to someplace called Decorah, Iowa and a friend of theirs, Jeanett, had come out to assist them. On the last day they were there, they needed help loading the U-Haul, and that is when I met Jeanett. When we were done, her and I stayed up all night discussing the stories of our lives and the next day, Monday, we bid each other a tearful farewell and she departed in the truck. On Friday, I flew in to La Crosse, Wisconsin, drove down to Decorah, found Jeanett and ask her to marry me. On 26 December it will be 32 years. Sometimes you just have to have Faith.
