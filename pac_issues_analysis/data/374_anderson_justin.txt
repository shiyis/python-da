“My views are conservative, but one cannot discredit all ideas simply because they are put forth by another party.

DISTRICT CONNECTICUT

Justin is a Lieutenant Colonel who earned the Bronze Star serving in Afghanistan, a union member who oversaw our state’s most dangerous criminals at a maximum security prison and a selfless public servant, currently running for the U.S. House of Representatives.

Justin doesn’t just talk about foreign policy, he’s lived it. He doesn’t just talk about public safety, he’s lived it. He didn’t just move to our district; he’s been a Connecticut resident for decades. His knowledge of state and national issues is readily apparent whenever he speaks.
