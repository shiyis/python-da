Education Press Release

THE REOPENING OF SCHOOLS IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC: STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ARE NOT EXPENDABLE

There is a push to get students back in school, but the timing is not right. At this present moment of uncertainty, students and teachers should be using alternate methods. There is no reason for them to return to the classroom when online options are available. Mr. Chresal Threadgill, Superintendent of the Mobile County Public School System took the well-being of the students, faculty, and staff into consideration by making the decision to begin the school year remotely for the 1st nine weeks. An assessment will be done to determine whether or not traditional school will begin. If it does, there will be three options in place- traditional, remote, or virtual.

Students, faculty, and staff should not be forced into an environment where they have to spend more time taking precautions instead of learning and teaching. This return, especially when the numbers are surpassing 800 confirmed cases daily, is a tremendous threat to the health of those that are encountering each other. According to the Alabama Department of Public Health, in the last two weeks of July, there was a 40 percent increase of cases among children, accounting for 97, 078 during that time frame.

MOBILE, AL — Students and teachers are putting their families and loved ones at risk by returning back to the classroom despite the surging cases of COVID-19.

Many school districts across the state are returning back to the traditional classroom for the 2020-2021 school year. The faculty and staff of these schools have undergone training and prepared the school for what they consider a safe return. Even though measures of sanitizing, social distancing, and temperature screenings are taking place, the threat of COVID-19 still looms on buses, in halls, in restrooms, and in classrooms. This means that the health of many students and teachers, especially those with pre-existing health conditions, are at stake.

On August 12, Baldwin County returned back to school, and Spanish Fort High School has nine students that have been diagnosed or are suspected of contracting the virus. This information was released to the parents via email by Principal Brian Williamson. Just last week Saraland High School had five reported cases after their first day. Even though it is not evident that the virus was contracted at the schools, this proves how easily COVID-19 can spread due to students and teachers being in enclosed spaces.


At the end of the day, some students and teachers may go home to people that are considered high risk if they contract the virus. It is all about protecting the health of all people. We have to do what is right to protect the students and teachers. They are not expendable.

One of the most important aspects of Congress is developing laws. New laws are created every week and if elected to Congress, I will be actively involved in drafting, sponsoring and supporting legislation about issues that are important to you.

Averhart is an avid proponent of protecting civil rights as one of the most important responsibilities for Members of Congress. Averhart believes that all people have a right to participate in our government and our society without fear, oppression, or discrimination.

As Congressman, Averhart will continue to fight for end-to-end criminal justice reform. To ensure accountable and constitutional policing, he will fight to increase the civil rights division, renew and expand pattern and practice investigations, enforce consent decrees, and support legislation to end racial profiling.

Social Security is a contract between the government and American workers. It is also the foundation for a secure retirement. For over seven decades, this essential program has provided economic security that families could rely on in times of need.

As your Representative in Congress, Averhart will remain committed to reaching across the aisles—working with all political affiliations to support feasible options that are both efficient and effective, to ensure quality affordable health care for all.

Averhart is committed to supporting wage-support policies that will impact the federal minimum wage, and work-sharing programs that will prove to reduce unemployment.

Averhart will support policies and initiatives that strengthen the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. Averhart is committed to ensuring budget appropriations that give the EPA the necessary resources that have long been denied.

Averhart, like you, understands that the U.S. labor force is the pillar of our nation’s strength. We must protect and advance the rights and benefits that our labor force needs to work with dignity and create better lives for themselves and their families.

Averhart is committed to fighting for sensible policies to support the growing industry of Agriculture. A critical building block in our country’s foundation, Alabama’s agricultural industry is one of the top industries in the state, contributing over $70 billion to the state’s annual economy.

Averhart, a decorated Marine Veteran, understands the issues surrounding military personnel. Averhart proudly supports the men and women of the United States Armed Forces who sacrifice to keep the nation safe and secure.

I will be dedicated to advocating for policies to raise wages, increasing job training programs, providing sustainable supports to small businesses, and supporting equal pay for equal work. Working families make up the backbone of our economy. Therefore, it is imperative that working families prosper, so that our country prospers.

I would like to thank the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) for their endorsement. I understand that the U.S. labor force is the pillar of our nation’s strength. We must protect and advance the rights and benefits that our labor force needs to work with dignity and create better lives for themselves and their families.

The AFL-CIO mobilizes its members and community partners to advocate for social and economic justice and strive daily to vanquish oppression and make communities better for all people—regardless of race, color, gender, religion, age, sexual orientation, or ethnic or national origin. With this being the mission, this organization has the overall goal of improving the lives of working families.

Racism at its core—whether overt or covert, once the ugly head has been raised, must be properly and swiftly addressed. Rep. Dismukes has shown derelict in his duty as a servant leader of the people of Millbrook, Alabama, his colleagues in the Alabama House of Representatives and the people of Alabama. We cannot tolerate this disdainful behavior from anyone, especially our elected officials. The swift, but necessary action to be taken should be immediate resignation by Rep. Dismukes. He has proven his inability to lead the people of his district and should therefore be relieved of this honor. To idly stand by and allow this travesty puts a stamp of approval on the perpetual system of racism that has existed far too long…People, it is time to eradicate hate regardless of its shape, form, or size. #EradicateHate

As the world was mourning the loss of a great civil rights leader, staunch supporter of racial justice and esteemed member of our United States Congress, The Honorable John Lewis, these were the words not so eloquently written in Representative Will Dismukes’ Facebook post. Representative Dismukes attended the birthday celebration of the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan—a Confederate general who played a key role in the massacre of over 300 black soldiers at Fort Pillow—a person by the name of Nathan Bedford Forrest. Just by the written words of Rep. Dismukes, one can easily surmise that this is an event he has attended before and is proud to be in the midst of other celebrants glamourizing a person who harbored despicable intent for a whole race of people—fellow human beings. Rep. Dismukes’ blatant lack of compassion for blacks and blatant lack of judgement is appalling at best. How can one take an oath to govern impartially for a diverse constituency when it is clear, that there is a darkness in his very soul that will not allow him to endeavor to such a noble calling?

Mobile, AL—Had a great time at Fort Dixie speaking and giving the invocation for Nathan Bedford Forrest annual birthday celebration. Always a great time and some sure enough good eating!
