Jimmy is a cosponsor of the Green New Deal with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Additionally, in Congress, Jimmy helped secure over $300 million to clean up a polluted river in California and sponsored the Climate Solutions Act of 2019 to reduce green gas emissions and transition to a 100 percent renewable energy future by 2035.

Jimmy is the only candidate endorsed by the United Nurses Associations of California and the National Union of Healthcare Workers.

As the owner of a shelter dog, Austin, Jimmy Gomez is a huge proponent of animal adoption from shelters and rescues. In Congress, Jimmy has pushed to increase enforcement funding to protect endangered species from poaching, add penalties for animal cruelty and allow expanded access for service animals for veterans.

Congressman Jimmy Gomez believes every student should have the opportunity to attend college without taking on debt. Jimmy was the beneficiary of a public education and attended community college and UCLA. He knows that a good education can transform a student’s life, but only if they are not burdened by hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans. As someone who graduated with student loan debt himself, Jimmy understands the pressure that recent graduates face when trying to start their lives and careers while simultaneously paying their student loan debt. Jimmy cosponsored the Debt-Free College Act (H.R 1571), the College for All Act (H.R. 1880) and supports student loan forgiveness.

Jimmy is a strong ally in the fight for LGBTQIA Rights. In Congress, Jimmy has opposed any effort to advance so-called “religious liberty” bills which are attempts to legitimize discrimination against LGBT individuals and families and maintain advances made by the Obama Administration to protect LGBT rights, protections and services. In the Assembly, Jimmy successfully sponsored bills signed into law, which required senior care facilities to undergo training on serving LGBTQIA seniors, and another to change birth certificates for same gender couples.

Jimmy Gomez, as a son of immigrants, knows that immigration and diversity contributes to the fabric of this country and makes us better. That’s why Jimmy has fought against Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda, including efforts to ban immigrants based on religion, splitting up families to deport parents of U.S. citizens and separating families at the border. In Congress, Jimmy was only 1 of 19 democrats who voted against legislation to fund Donald Trump’s border wall, his demand for more detention beds, and increased funding for ICE. source: www.rollcall.com https://tinyurl.com/y3muxuc7

Jimmy will always stand up and fight for all of us by protecting immigrants through the passage of the Dream and Promise Act, implementing comprehensive immigration reform that keeps families together, and bringing undocumented persons out of the shadows with a path to citizenship.

Jimmy supports safe communities, which includes criminal justice reform to ensure equal access to justice regardless of income. As an Assemblyman, Jimmy co-authored legislation to ban the use of for-profit prisons in California and supported bail reform and sentencing reform for non-violent offenses. In Congress, he voted to pass the FIRST STEP Act that shortened mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offences.

As a member of the Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Sub-Committee, Congressman Gomez is leading efforts to investigate, and expose aggressive policing tactics committed by “cliques” of affiliated deputies within the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department.

Jimmy is an environmental champion and received the Green Leadership Award for “bold environmental leadership” from Green California, a coalition of over 100 environmental organizations, and is endorsed by the Sierra Club.

Last year, Jimmy also sponsored the For the 99.8% Act (H.R. 4857), with Senator Bernie Sanders. This bill will close a Trump tax loophole for billionaires while raising the trillions of dollars needed for essential services, including healthcare, education, housing and more. Senator Bernie Sanders is the sponsor of the companion bill in the Senate (S.309).

Congressman Jimmy Gomez believes ending police brutality and criminal justice reform must be a top priority for Congress. Jimmy is a cosponsor of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act (H.R. 7120). This bill will hold police officers and departments accountable, increase transparency, make structural changes to our justice system, ban chokeholds and eliminate qualified immunity.

Jimmy will protect Medicare and Social Security from GOP “restructuring” and oppose cuts to safety net programs like Meals on Wheels and heating assistance. He supports Windfall Elimination Provision reform and expanding Social Security to strengthen the program in the long term. He opposes Donald Trump’s payroll tax cut because it will undermine the short and long-term solvency of Social Security.

Through their service, veterans have sacrificed for all of us. America needs to repay that service and sacrifice by fully funding veterans programs, including VA medical benefits and mental health support programs, job training, VHA loans, housing and other support programs. We need to ensure that our veterans have the support they need. Congressman Gomez introduced the Wage Adjustment for Veterans Enrolled in School (WAVES) Act. The bill would raise the minimum wage standard for full-time or 3/4-time students within the Federal Work Study program under the GI Bill.

Congressman Gomez has been a champion of campaign finance reform in the Assembly and Congress. Jimmy was the principal author of the California DISCLOSE Act, which expanded campaign reform and disclosures in California. He supports the overturn of Citizen’s United with the goal of public financing of elections. Jimmy helped pass H.R. 1, the For the People Act, which is the most comprehensive anti-corruption and democracy reform bill to pass the House since Watergate. This legislation will limit the influence of big money in politics, strengthen ethics rules for public servants” and create a small-donor public financing matching system.

Jimmy supports banning the use of private prisons by ICE and co-sponsored the Justice is Not for Sale Act by Rep. Raul Grijalva to do just that. He also is fighting to allow unannounced visits by Members of Congress to ICE and Custom Border Patrol Facilities to provide greater oversight and accountability.

We can count on Jimmy Gomez to be our local voice and continue the fight to deliver the progressive results our community needs.

Jimmy Gomez lives in Eagle Rock and with his wife Mary, his mother-in-law Sally and their dog Austin.

Jimmy is also a strong champion of environmental equity, helping eliminate student debt, protecting women’s right to choose, expanding access to education, domestic violence and sexual assault prevention, campaign finance reform, LGBTQ rights, affordable housing and defending and expanding the gains we have made under the Affordable Care Act.

Right out of high school Jimmy began working at a fast-food restaurant and a local retail store stocking shelves overnight, gaining a better understanding of his parent’s struggle to make ends meet, the need for a good job with benefits, and most importantly a quality education. With this newfound clarity, he enrolled in community college, graduated from UCLA, and later earned a Master’s in Public Policy from Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. Jimmy recognizes that his story, although not unique, today entails an even more difficult path and is out of reach for far too many.

Jimmy Gomez is a working-class progressive helping lead a new generation of Democrats, fighting for and delivering change.

Jimmy began his public service as soon as he completed his education, as an organizer fighting for working families in his community with AFSCME CA and later as an advocate for our front-line nurses represented by United Nurses Association of California (UNAC/UHCP).

In reaction to the election of Donald Trump, on June 6, 2017 the voters of the 34th District elected Jimmy as our Representative in Congress, where he has stood up to the White House’s attacks on immigrants, education, health care, voting rights, civil rights, and the environment. In fact, Jimmy is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, the Dream Act, the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and the HELP Separated Children Act, which protects children affected by immigration enforcement actions. He has a proven progressive record, voting to stop Republican attempts to fund Trump’s border wall, more detention beds, and increased funding for ICE.
