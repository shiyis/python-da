Economic Expansion

Standing Up Against the Liberal Agenda

Fighting for Family Values

 <tag> p


With Democrats in power, the far left will push radical economic and social policies. Conservatives like me will fight to oppose these radical ideas.

Robert is a staunch pro-lifer, conservative, and fights against the liberal’s cultural agenda. He’s a champion for religious freedom, both at home and across the globe.

Alex Vanderford most recently worked as the North Alabama field director for the Bradley Byrne Senate Campaign. He also worked as the Grassroots Coordinator/Coalitions Director for Marsha Blackburn’s senate campaign in Tennessee.

Alex is a native of Muscle Shoals in Colbert County in the 4th District and is a graduate of Martin Methodist College in Pulaski, Tennessee.

I take pride in the fact that President Trump received a higher percentage of the vote in the 4th Congressional District than any congressional district in the nation. During the past four years, I have formed a personal relationship with President Trump, and we have fought side by side for rural America. “
