AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE

 <tag> p


Oz believes that our government needs to do more to lower healthcare costs for everyone and ensure all Americans have access to quality care. The costs of coverage and prescription drugs are rising faster than inflation, forcing families to choose between buying medicine and putting food on the table. Meanwhile, Brian Mast and Republicans in Congress have actively stonewalled efforts to bring costs down, voting against legislation like H.R. 3. In Congress, Oz will always stand up for Americans’ access to affordable healthcare and against Republican attempts to take it away.
