Cheryl Fair commented 3 months ago Dear Representative Costa, Congress and the Senate must STOP Trump from any military type attempt to exit the presidency on Wednesday! It is meant only as a signal/photo op for more insurrection—the proud leader leaving with the good graces of the US Military/goodbye to all who love me/I’ll be back. This cannot stand. It cannot be allowed. Absolutely no Air Force One. Watching all the footage of January 6th, I realize What Mussolini said now applies to America: “Facism was the moment when you could no longer pass a cigarette paper between the media and political power.” Trump could now be the author of that statement. No red carpet, no military band, no Airforce One!

david commented 4 months ago Hello, this is Dave. My comment is on the 2nd round of possible stimulus checks Dec 2020. I can agree with the support of the unemployment system however feel that the direct checks is a waste of funding. Not that it will not get spent, but is not wisely distributed. I personally know of those (more than a few) that kept their jobs and pay constant that got that first “bonus”. Without the need. If the stimulus is going forward then make it flat rate per taxpayer NOT a sliding scale. The per child bonus just further penalizes those that do not have children ie: tax deductions for dependent children. also support the Indian farmers,

About Jim

Dwight Wimbley commented 2 months ago Here was the real problem with article of impeachment and why it failed. The problem that Donald Trump speech incited his followers to commit acts of violence against the US. Government. It failed because they did not properly charge that Donald Trump failed to up hold his oath under Title 5 U.S.C. 3331. He took an oth to,protect and defend the United States of America against all enemies foreign and domestic. When he didn’t send help to stop the attack and attempted assassination of the Vice-president and the Speaker of the House. Didn’t Congress look at the laws and theactions when they planned to address the actions of Donald Trump for impeachment ? I am saddened when they rush things and miss things like the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court decision in R.A.V. Vs. St. Paul 505 U.S 377 (1992) basically created the avenue of protected hate speech and reasserted fighting words as protected speech. I could have secured a conviction of Donald Trump for violating his oath to support and defend the government of the United States for failing to send help to stop the attack on the U.S. Capitol and the attempted assassination of the Vice-president and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. I am not an attorney but I do have Masrers Degree in Law. Basic legal research into the issues and actions that day would have lead the House have and article of impeachment on the charge of derlection of his duties under Title 5 U.S.C section 3331. And the nnotnthe spurious charge that he incited the action of the rioters.

Nancy Dailey commented 3 months ago Congressman Costa: I am scared of what the President will do in his last 11 days in office and it appears as if no strategy to remove him in that short a period of time is viable. Further, I am scared that the assault on our capitol will serve as a “recruiting” event for other angry, disenfranchised, primarily white males who feel their power over this country slipping away. What is being done to protect us from Trump’s madness in the next 11 days? What is being done to break through the hostility towards anything or anybody who is perceived as “other” that is pervasive, to the tune of 72 million people, in our country today? I am 70 years old and a veteran of many a protest march in my young years. But what I am seeing happening before my eyes today is almost 100% different in terms of the hostile, dangerous actions being taken by this group of people. Were we angry then? Of course we were!! But the level of destructive and threatening actions towards people and property cannot be compared with this. I am not saying it never happened during protests against the Viet Nam war and marches for Civil Rights, but never do I remember it being with this kind of vitriolic hatred towards all who are not within a very narrow band of violent speech and behavior. I would very much appreciate any information you can provide, Nancy Dailey

Posted on December 06, 2019 8:00 AM · 1 reaction

Congressman Jim Costa’s campaign announced today that he has won the sole endorsement of Planned Parenthood Action Fund.

Senator Hurtado said: “Jim Costa understands the Valley and we need someone with his experience in Congress. Jim has been a fearless advocate for our families, standing up for our shared Valley values. From defending our DREAMers, to making sure our economy leaves no one behind, and expanding access to healthcare throughout our communities, Jim works hard to fight for the Valley both as a Congressmember and also as an ally in Sacramento.

Nothing is as important to our Valley’s future as a clean and reliable water supply. Over the past two years, we’ve been successful in providing more flexibility for water managers and Valley farmers and will continue to push for more water, including funding to improve our infrastructure and build more storage.

My family immigrated to the Valley, where we have been farming for 112 years. Our story is the American story of immigration, families who come here to build a better life.

We’ve brought tax dollars back to our Valley – improving roads, hiring police officers, funding schools and colleges and passing a Farm Bill that keeps Valley agriculture growing.

The grandson of Portuguese immigrants, Congressman Jim Costa is an active third-generation family farmer and lifelong San Joaquin Valley resident. Costa is a product of Fresno County schools; he graduated from San Joaquin Memorial High School. His Bachelor's Degree in Political Science is from California State University, Fresno.

Since 2010, the number of uninsured people in our Congressional district has dropped by half, but affordable healthcare will always be a priority. I’m continuing my work to expand healthcare, increasing funding for our community hospitals and health clinics and making drug prices affordable.

Now more than ever, we need leaders with the experience to find common sense solutions to the problems we face. As your Congressman, I work hard to get things done for our Valley.

We have more to do – join my efforts to reinvest in our future and keep our Valley strong.

I’ve championed comprehensive immigration reform, keeping families together and protecting the Dreamers from the uncertainty no one should have to endure.

To ensure our veterans get what they’ve earned, I secured funding to open the Fresno Veterans Home and worked to improve access for veteran’s healthcare.
