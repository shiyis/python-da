 <tag> p




I first became interested in public service at an early age when I watched my single working mother struggle to fight an unwarranted tax bill from the California State Board of Equalization. As an immigrant who owned a small business, my mother lacked the resources she needed to appeal to the state agency and reluctantly acquiesced to the board’s demands.

After watching my own mother struggle, I knew I needed to help those who couldn’t help themselves and be a strong voice for the voiceless. I knew I needed to serve my community, so I decided to run for public office.

As a young adult, I came to America with my mother and two younger sisters from South Korea. Like so many before me and many more after me, my family came to America searching for opportunities with the hope for a better future.

I pledged to oppose all new taxes, prevent any tax increases, and presume all taxpayers are innocent until proven guilty when adjudicating tax appeals. I also led the fight to return nearly $400 million back to California taxpayers who were victims of a tax system that had failed us.

I successfully ran for the California State Board of Equalization, the very agency that showed me how broken our political system is, and I quickly worked to make much needed, common-sense reforms.

I ran for Congress because Orange County needs a strong voice in Washington, D.C. who will honor promises made and stand up for us and our values. I will continue to be that voice, and fight to serve our community each and every day in Washington.

I served as the Chairwoman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors where I work tirelessly on behalf of all Orange County families fighting higher taxes, reducing traffic congestion in our communities, and ensuring our bays and coastlines are clean.

At the California State Board of Equalization, I became the country’s highest ranking Korean American officeholder and California’s highest-ranking Republican woman, which gave me a unique platform to give back to my country by empowering the next generation of women and minority leaders in our community.

Now I am in Congress fixing our broken political system and fighting through partisan gridlock that is hurting Americans and we deserve better.

As a young adult, I came to America with my mother and two younger sisters from South Korea. Like so many before me and many more after me, my family came to America searching for opportunities with the hope for a better future.

I’m a public servant, mother, and proven tax-fighter working in Congress to create jobs, hold government accountable, and ensure it always works for the people it serves.

When I served as the Chairwoman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, I fought against higher taxes, helped guide our county through COVID-19, and provided support for vulnerable communities. During my time in public office, I have returned over $400 million to California taxpayers and have focused on fixing a broken tax system that is holding families and businesses back.

I successfully ran for the California State Board of Equalization, the very agency that showed me how broken our political system is, and I quickly worked to make much needed, common-sense reforms.

In Congress, I am fighting to lower taxes and allow Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money, especially during these uncertain times. I am working to slow the spread of COVID-19, protect Orange County residents, and increase hospital resources. I am also working to fix our broken healthcare system to cover those with pre-existing conditions, lower prescription drug prices, and ensure Americans have access to quality, affordable healthcare.

I knew I needed to serve my community, so I decided to run for public office.

After watching my single working mother struggle to fight an unwarranted tax bill from the California State Board of Equalization, I realized that, however well-intended, government was failing the people that needed it most.

Orange County needs true leadership in Washington, D.C.; a voice that will fight for this community. I have been blessed to live my American Dream and that is why I am proud to serve this community in Congress. Together, we can ensure future generations have hope for a better future and opportunities to prosper.
