As a lifelong resident of Garland County, it is a privilege to be raising my family here. I ran for Congress to ensure that my children and your children have a brighter future as well as a federal government that treats them fairly. It is why I ran and why I serve in Congress today.

My name is Bruce Westerman, and it is an honor to be serving as your Member of Congress from the Fourth District of Arkansas. It is a privilege to fight to make government more fair to you, the hardworking Arkansas taxpayer, and create an environment where we can grow good-paying jobs for Arkansas workers.

I am asking for your continued support as I fight to move Arkansas forward by pushing for lower taxes, reforming our healthcare system and advocating for conservative values. I hope you'll join our campaign by liking our page and signing up to volunteer.

For more than 22 years, Bruce worked in engineering and forestry at Mid-South Engineering in Hot Springs. Developing a passion for public service, Bruce served as a board member on the Fountain Lake School District.

When the 4th Congressional District seat opened up in late 2013, Bruce was encouraged to take his conservative leadership to Congress. He won single-handedly, defeating both primary and general election opponents. In Washington, Congressman Westerman currently serves on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Natural Resources Committee, and is the Ranking Member of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee.

By continuing to work together, we will make a difference for Arkansas.

After graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biological and Agricultural Engineering, he received his Master's degree in forestry from Yale University.

Bruce continues to call Hot Springs home. He is married to Sharon Westerman and they have four children. They are members of Walnut Valley Baptist Church where Bruce is a deacon and teaches Sunday school. Besides spending time serving his family and the people of the 4th District of Arkansas, Bruce loves spending time hunting and fishing, especially on Lake Ouachita.

PAID FOR BY WESTERMAN FOR CONGRESS PO BOX 21097 | HOT SPRINGS, AR 71903

That dedication to public service grew, and in 2010, he was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives. In 2012, Bruce was elected by his peers as the House Minority Leader, and in 2013 he became the first Republican House Majority Leader since Reconstruction. In the Arkansas legislature, Bruce championed conservative principles: lower taxes, limited government, and strong family values.

Deep-rooted in Arkansas, Bruce Westerman was born and raised in Garland County. He graduated from Fountain Lake High School in Hot Springs before attending the University of Arkansas where he played football for the Razorbacks.
