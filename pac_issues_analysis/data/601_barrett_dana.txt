 <tag> p




I believe our government MUST be made more efficient and less susceptible to party politics. While fixing the dysfunction in our government may not be great for getting headlines, I see it as the root cause of many of our bigger issues. I believe in the Constitution but recognize that it was intended to be a living document that could and should be amended as befits the times and best serves all Americans. I support and will work for:

Fair & transparent pricing of health services & pharmaceuticals

Term limits and a rebalancing of the power in Washington

I’m a socially liberal, fiscally responsible Democrat who believes in working across the aisle and representing ALL of the citizen’s of Georgia’s 11th District. In order to solve our country’s most pressing issues we have to pull back from the partisanship and work together. As a nation, our propensity to elect leaders solely because of a specific position, party affiliation or self-interest has led us to where we are today. We have to ask more of ourselves and of those we elect. I am committed to working on any issue we face by listening, learning, consulting experts, believing science, using common sense and compassion, and abiding by a strong ethical and moral code.

I believe that to achieve true equality in America we must remove barriers based on zip code, race, gender or any other perceived differences and provide public education, justice and healthcare systems that serve all equally. I am committed to:

Guaranteed protection for pre-existing conditions

Israel and the Middle East

Campaign finance reform that eliminates corporate money in politics

Mandating a fair wage that keeps pace with inflation

Immigration and Asylum

Abolishing the electoral college, ensuring free and fair elections, and ending the process of gerrymandering

Universal healthcare coverage

Climate Change and the Environment

Ending the racial and gender pay gaps and resulting wealth gap

Eliminating education inequity

As a breast cancer survivor, I am committed to ensuring that all Americans have access to affordable healthcare. I believe in a pragmatic approach to reform based on incremental changes that will begin to make a difference immediately. I will fight for:

Dana Barrett is a former tech executive and small business owner turned award-winning TV, radio, & podcast host. She left her daily talk radio show in the fall of 2019 to run for U.S. Congress because she could no longer stand on the sidelines and was ready to do more than talk. Throughout her business and media career, Dana has been an outspoken advocate for equality and ethics. She is known as a hard worker and a woman who does not shy away from a challenge. Those qualities led her to achieve successes in business and in the media after being told by industry insiders that what she wanted was not possible. As a talk radio host, Dana used her platform to tackle the difficult conversations with refreshing candor while connecting with her audience on a human level.

Active in the community, Dana serves on the board of Inspiredu, a non-profit that works to bridge the digital divide, and several years after surviving breast cancer in 2013, she became the official spokesperson for TurningPoint Breast Cancer Rehabilitation.

Originally from the suburbs of Philadelphia, Dana attended Cornell University and graduated with a degree in Hospitality Administration before moving to the metro Atlanta area in the late 1980s. An empty nester since 2010, Dana raised her daughter Lauren as a divorced, working single mom and says that is the accomplishment she is most proud of.

She has also given her time to emcee and moderate events for the Jewish Book Festival, TEDx Peachtree, and Partners Against Domestic Violence to name a few. She created a networking event series for women, and founded and runs a public book club that has been active for over a decade.

She’s a hard worker, a pragmatic problem solver, and she’s not afraid of a fight. That's who she is and how I know she'll serve as my next representative in Congress. - Buddy Darden, Former US Congressman

people over politics

we need leaders

the system is broken

change the system.

 <tag> p


I’m running for Congress because I believe we deserve leaders who will choose people over politics and who will put us before their own self-interests every day. I’m running because the system is broken… and in these unprecedented times, no matter which side you’re on, that has become glaringly clear. I’m running because I believe we need leaders who are thinking long term, and not just legislating to the next election or the next poll, or worse yet to satisfy their patrons or boost their own egos. I’m running because I believe we need to get in the system to change the system.

Dana Barrett is an award-winning talk radio host, a former tech exec, a small business owner, a breast cancer survivor, and a proud single mom. But more importantly, Dana is your neighbor, the mom in the carpool lane behind you, the friend at bookclub, and the sister who steps up in a crisis. What she's NOT is a Washington insider or a career politician.
