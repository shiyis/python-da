AMERICA FIRST

I am committed to ALWAYS put people over politics.

I am, Josh Barnett and I am running to represent the people of Arizona Congressional District 6. As a business owner and family man, I have witnessed the corruption and disregard for our Constitution that is eroding liberty in our country. Instead of doing what is right, politicians are pushing legislation and bad ideas in order to advance themselves or their political party without regard for the people. In a time of great political divide, our communities need strong leaders that will look past the rhetoric, speak the truth and restore faith in America. I believe true leaders need to have the following qualities: compassion and love for the people, integrity to do what is right even when it is not popular, strength and courage to see it through and they must stand on strong morals and Constitutional principles.
