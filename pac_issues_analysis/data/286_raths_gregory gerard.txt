A political science associate professor and a social sciences associate professor (who are both former Democratic candidates for elected office) wrote an op-ed calling for the renaming of John Wayne Airport. I condemn John Wayne’s 1971 comments, but historians remind us that we must judge people in the context of their times and the totality of their work. READ MORE →

We are happy to announce that over the week we had many successful rallies, events, and fantastic volunteers.

As other campaigns have forgone door-knocking, the Republican has gone anyway, accepting the risks of contracting, or spreading, coronavirus. The fiscal hawk and social conservative believes those risks are minimal and follows some social distancing protocols, stepping away as the occupants come to greet him. He wears a mask, and when he hands out materials, he does so wearing a glove. READ MORE →

Porter deserves a large share of credit for the Democratic successes in this closely divided district. She has quickly garnered a national reputation as a crusader for progressive causes. If fund-raising is a sign of success, her $8 million war chest reportedly is more than 10 times larger than that of her opponent, Mission Viejo City Councilman Greg Raths. READ MORE →

Orange County, CA (June 30, 2020) – Colonel Greg Raths, USMC (Ret.), a Mission Viejo Councilman, has received the endorsement of Crime Survivors PAC. He is the Republican nominee for the House of Representatives against freshman incumbent Representative Katie Porter (D-Irvine), who is endorsed by none of the mayors in the 45th District. The district has a 2.4% Republican registration advantage.

Good Afternoon Team Raths,

Councilman/Retired USMC Colonel Greg Raths Endorsed by Crime Survivors PAC for California’s 45th Congressional District

The race for the 45th congressional district in South Orange County reveals the county’s remarkable shift away from the Republican Party. The district had been a GOP stronghold, but Democratic consumer attorney Katie Porter won a three-point victory in 2018’s blue-wave election. Most analysts now rate this as a Democratic-leaning seat.

Thank you to all of my supporters!!

COVID-19 and China

 <tag> strong


Paid for by Greg Raths for Congress 2020 Committee

 <tag> p




Greg Raths has strongly supported the mobilization of all of the federal government’s resources in response to the worst pandemic that the world has seen in over 100 years. In March, he urged passage of the $2 trillion relief package, the CARES Act. This historic package brought billions in aid to Californians to help local hospitals, schools, and more. Hundreds of billions of additional dollars were provided to small businesses, employees, and those unemployed through no fault of their own.

He also supports reforming unemployment benefits so people make up to 100% of their income but aren’t disincentivized from going back to work. As soon as he takes office, he will immediately author legislation to do just that. Congress must also pass liability protections to ensure that businesses aren’t sued for reopening when they follow the rules. Without this, businesses will be overwhelmed with lawsuits.

It’s estimated that 90 percent of the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) used in the United States today is made in China. Greg will lead the effort to bring the medical supply chain home and manufacture PPE in the United States. He will support the US MADE Act, which will ensure PPE is made here in America and treated as a resource on par with military equipment.

Next, Greg Raths supports additional stimulus payments to low and moderate income families, and he supports providing funding to help schools reopen safely.

26551 Maside Mission Viejo, CA 92692 949-292-2468

Combatting this virus is a team effort, and Greg believes all Americans should closely follow CDC guidelines to keep themselves safe, which can be found here.

While the CARES Act was a critical first step, more is needed to combat COVID-19 and get our economy moving again.

First, Greg Raths will continue to work closely with the administration to ensure the speedy discovery of therapeutics to lessen the severity of this virus and a vaccine to prevent further spread.

Greg Raths will also work to ensure we hold China accountable for the role they played in allowing the virus to spread. He will introduce a sanctions bill aimed at forcing China to cooperate with all investigations into the virus.

You have my word.

You have my word.

Greg Raths Colonel U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.)

26551 Maside Mission Viejo, CA 92692 949-292-2468

After retiring for the Marine Corps in 2004, I flew for Jet Blue Airways as a commercial airline pilot, then went into business as president of a successful company in Anaheim.

I know firsthand how high taxes and excessive regulations can make running a business very difficult. I was elected to the Mission Viejo City Council in 2014, re-elected in 2018, and served as Mayor in 2019. As Mayor, crime was reduced by 27%, the 2019 budget had a $6 million surplus, and unemployment was lowered below 2%.

As a combat decorated fighter pilot, I flew 75 combat missions in Iraq, Kuwait, and Somalia flying the F/A-18 Hornet. As the Assistant Chief of Staff of The White House Military Office I kept communications between the Commander-in-Chief and Pentagon intact during extreme uncertainty. I performed my duties to the highest standards.

Finally, I’ll ensure that Orange County remains a safe, prosperous, and great place to live and raise a family. That takes responsible and experienced leadership.

As your U.S. Representative my top priorities will be to permanently lower individual taxes, raise business deductions, and stop illegal immigration. I will fight to lower healthcare premiums and prescription drug prices, expand coverage to pre-existing conditions, and allow every American access to low group rates.

Serving my country and community has been a big part of my life. I moved to Orange County in 1977 when I was assigned to the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station flying the F-4Phantom II. I met my wife Luci in 1980, married in 1982, and Orange County has been our home ever since where we raised our three children.
