Our country is in crisis, and too many politicians prioritize their political party and personal gain over what’s best for our country.

DEFENDING HEALTH CARE

AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL

FIGHTING CORRUPTION

PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT

 <tag> h3


CONTRIBUTE NOW

 <tag> p




Taxes are out of control in California and our economy is sinking. I’m fighting to lower taxes for Orange County families by bringing back the ability to deduct mortgage interest and state and local taxes from federal taxes — but it’s not enough.

Washington is filled with corrupt politicians looking for backroom deals. While serving on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, I’ve rooted out government waste, fraud, and abuse. I’ve investigated big chemical executives and crooked Trump administration officials. I’ve questioned anyone and everyone who’s wasted taxpayer dollars and corrupted our institutions.

In the middle of a pandemic, the Trump Administration has worked to dismantle protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions, eliminate Medicare, and threaten women’s reproductive rights. We need to improve and expand health care coverage — not dismantle it.

COVID-19 isn’t the only health emergency plaguing Orange County. My bipartisan bill to improve our nation’s response to the opioid crisis was signed into law, helping to address the deadly addiction crisis. I’ll keep reaching across the aisle to find common ground, but I will never compromise on protecting the health of Orange County families.

In the wake of the coronavirus, we must create a thriving, innovative, and balanced economy that is focused on creating the jobs of tomorrow. We need an economy that works for ALL, not just the super-rich.

The 48th Congressional District is one of the most remarkable places to live in the world. We must do everything we can to ensure our children and future generations can enjoy the pristine natural beauty, drink clean water, and breathe clean air.

As the Chair of the Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on Environment, I’ve been one of Congress’ biggest environmental leaders. I’ve protected our pristine coastlines from new offshore drilling. I’ve held the Trump Administration accountable, as they work to remove common sense environmental protections. I’ve pushed for solutions to address the climate crisis while incentivizing economic growth in Southern California.

Coastal regions like Orange County are already feeling the effects of the climate crisis. Flooding from sea level rises has destroyed our property, wildfires have threatened our safety and economic security, and extreme heat events are putting our most vulnerable at risk.

I’ll continue to fight for transparency and decency in Washington. Our community needs leaders who will fight government corruption, not crooked career politicians.

We need to join the rest of the advanced world and finally ensure that health care coverage is a right for every American. We need to make prescription drugs more affordable. We need to improve access to care.
