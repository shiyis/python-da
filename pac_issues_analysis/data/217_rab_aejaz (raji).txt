Upon being elected, bring immediate relief fighting poverty and unemployment and ensure that everyone is well represented in U.S. Congress, working towards a prosperous and peaceful life for all. Unlike special interest groups, my loyalties shall remain resolute towards public interest forever. I will attend to all the issues most expeditiously. I have dedicated my life to help all without any discrimination. I stand in complete contrast to the depleting and detrimental conditions faced by people for many years coupled with economic hardship, and increasing health hazards. It is time to unite as lives in District 30 matters and it's time for a new leadership. Upon being elected, I will work with all parties involved in the hazardous Santa Susana nuclear contamination and address the Porter Ranch gas leak to expedite most urgent relief. In order to address national security and terrorism issues it is necessary to change our approach to first develop real and strong friendly international relations that are dependable to collectively fight terrorism and defeat crimes against humanity. I will expedite new better paying jobs, promote small businesses, remove burdensome regulations, offer VA more options, ease student debt and remove harsh penalties. I will most sincerely protect the environment, encourage visionary prospects, ease healthcare and help speed process for those needing Medi-Cal, Medicare and Social Security. I will address water safety and energy issues, bring large business together to help promote small business. I will press to reduce the federal debt and work on Health Care Act for better options. I support peace, justice and dignity for all. I stand to compete in goodness, fight poverty, protect constitutional rights and secure all with health, happiness, and prosperity. It is time more than ever to unite above all discriminating factors of race, color, gender and religion, proving to the world that together we stand united as one for all and all for one.

This is my heartiest call for your support and your partnership. Please vote for me in this Congressional Election to set a better future for our children, our seniors and for us all. Our congressional office has not delivered any relief nor any advancement to the people for the past so many years, instead hushed up sexual misconduct against women have come out. Now you have a solemn duty, to vote for the same or to vote for a change. If you support decency, family values of respect and safety for women, Vote for me. If you support, Timesup and Metoo movements, Vote for me. If you want to unite above all discriminating factors of race, color, gender and religion, Vote for me. If you want advancement, better jobs, better health and better life for you and your children, Vote for me. If you care about putting America first, Vote for me. From a very young age, I have been blessed with many accomplishments in my life, I care and I will serve you better. God bless you and God bless America.

In view of growing public problems, worsening living conditions and invisible leadership, I entered the arena for the office of U.S. Congress to devote my life fighting for people and lead people towards progress and prosperity. In this good cause, I felt it my humanitarian duty to step up, to secure fundamental rights and to secure equal opportunity for all. I am not a typical politician and my past speaks for my future. Over the years, I have earned the respect of all, seen through motivated community volunteers supporting my campaign promotion and events. With worthy public support, I am confident to win the Congressional election and lead everyone especially our younger generation towards a successful direction.

My name is Raji Rab. I am seeking your vote for the Congressional Election in California's 30th District, to bring a much awaited relief to struggling communities. I am a seasoned Aviator, an Educator and an Entrepreneur, but above all, I am a humanitarian. Professionally at the age of 18, I got my commercial pilot license from Laverne California, owned a flight school, an airline and operated a computer infrastructure facility. Personally, I have served a lifetime, finding happiness in helping people without any compensation, which I believe is the best natural qualification to run for any political office. With the last 16 years of my life fully dedicated to helping diversified communities, I collectively cherish an eventful experience of over 35 years, possessing a sharp judgment of a security conscious aviator with innovative approach of a modern computer age operative.
