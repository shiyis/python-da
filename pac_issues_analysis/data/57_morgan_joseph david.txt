“An independent voice for common sense”

It ends with my belief in the Spirit of America firmly intact; with my head held high, my hands held out to continue that service, and my heart full. I thank all those who volunteered, who gave of their precious time and funds. I hope you will continue to strive with me to live up to the ideals our nation was built upon. To fight for liberty and your God-given rights. To serve where you are at to secure the promise of America for those around you and for generations to come.

Our race has reached the end of the line. What a run it was though. I met so many wonderful people, and have a heartful of memories. This race was begun, not to further myself, but to serve my community.

Freedom works best when freedom is free to flourish and is shared.

Joseph Morgan Candidate for U.S. Congress

Today’s issues are more important than ever. They represent how the country will run, and how it’s governed.

I’ve initially chosen some issues important to me and the citizens of our country and I’ll add more as they are presented to me.

A candidate’s position on issues represents his passion for America, his commitment to his constituents, his awareness and values.

With Mayor, Richard Fimbres, and S. Tucson Mayor, Bob Teso, and members of the non-profit group, the American Patriot Memorial.

I wrote for several years Western Free Press, an online, Arizona-based news outlet. Starting in 2017, I was a conservative columnist for the Arizona Daily Star, Tucson’s largest newspaper, an opportunity I surrendered when I announced my candidacy. I currently work for the Upward Bound program at Pima Community College, which assists underprivileged children in pursuing their dreams of higher education.

With jobs and economic prosperity constantly calling me to move away, I’ve resisted in order to stay in Tucson. I’ve done a little of everything, but my passion has always been history and politics. From my teenage years, I have been involved as a volunteer for numerous campaigns. Service is part of my life. From my earliest teenage years, I spent my summers helping my church in various building projects and doing ministry work at homeless shelters and nursing homes. I continue to volunteer at the Wilmot State Prison, and am a founding board member of a local non-profit, the American Patriot Memorial, which advocates for the promotion of patriotism in our community.

Tucson has often been referred to as a big city with a little town feel, and it is. This welcoming, laid-back, and friendly attitude is among the many charms that draw people to the Southwest even today, that and the ever-plentiful sunshine! I received a Masters in U.S. history with an emphasis on American constitutionalism from the UA and a minor in Aerospace Mechanical Engineering. My first job out of college was as a financial advisor. After four years, and successfully battling cancer, I switched career paths to teach history at Pima Community College, while tutoring mathematics on the side

Since then, this nation’s history can be summed up as an attempt to live up to the ideals laid out in that document. It has cost us dearly in blood, yet, that blood has brought liberty to people, both here at home and abroad. You may call me an idealist, but I believe that, indeed, every person has the right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” I believe it is the solemn duty of government of secure those rights. To that end government exists, and for no other purpose.

I was born and raised in Tucson, AZ. Southwestern Arizona has always been my home. I love the people. I love the culture. I especially love the food. We are a community that has always thrived on the quintessential American ideal of creating a melting pot of peoples, no matter their birthplace, status, or religious creed. One of the leaders in the creation of the Arizona territory, and Tucson’s first Hispanic mayor, was Estevan Ochoa. This region was home to a large contingent of the all-black regiments, the buffalo soldiers, stationed at Fort Huachuca. Being a border region, Mexicans along with the already planted Native peoples, who already called the area home, early on infused their legacy and traditions into the fabric of the communities that sprung up. Immigrants from around the world came to the mining towns of Tombstone, and Douglas, while the rail lines brought ever increasing additions to the cultural and ethnic milieu. Each group brought their own unique cultural contributions to what would become their new home.

Commitment to this ideal has been lost, and the halls of government are filled with professionals who have proper pedigree, but no heart for service. Rather than promote ideas that will contribute to the freedom of Americans, many in the political class have been about amassing wealth and power for themselves at the expense of those they represent. This country belongs to us all, and if we don’t come together, and listen to one another, we will lose it.

I can promise that if elected I will fight for and champion the just, natural rights of all my constituents and all citizens of this country. I will work tirelessly to keep my constituents informed on issues by first educating myself. They will then be in a better position to direct my service to them.

My passion for history, and especially the history of this, the greatest and freest nation the world has ever seen, has compelled me to take up the call to be a public servant. I consider it the greatest fortune of my life to have been born in the United States. My love of learning inevitably led me from an early age to politics and the ideas that formed this nation. What makes us so different? It is our ideals. No other nation has a Declaration of Independence like ours. No other group of men put down on paper for all to see such a sweeping tribute to self-evident truth, and then fought to defend them and see them implemented.
