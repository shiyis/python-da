Our health care system is critical to our wellbeing and way of life. As Alaskans and Americans live longer, the demand for qualified health providers will continue to grow

The United States has experienced tragedies caused by individuals who used a firearm, several of which have been declared acts of terrorism.


Over the last 45 years, I have worked tirelessly to address the crucial infrastructure needs throughout our great state. Before being elected to public office, I saw firsthand the problems we had with a lack of infrastructure as a tug and barge operator along the Yukon River.

Any dollar contribution will be both appreciated and will go a long way as we travel the campaign trail together!

As a former teacher, I am committed to ensuring that our nation’s children are provided with the best education possible. I strongly believe that all children have a right to study in safe and productive learning environments and that America has a responsibility to provide exemplary education across the board.


Contributions are not tax deductible for income tax purposes. Federal Law requires political committees to report the name, mailing address, occupation & name of employer of individuals whose contributions exceed $200 in an election cycle.

Without adequately providing for the defense of our nation, the U.S. will cease to be the beacon of freedom we are today.


Said quite simply, America must become energy independent. We have no other choice unless we are prepared to continue financing foreign governments. But the good news is that we have the ability to and that Alaska can lead the way.
