Growing up in socialist-controlled Ukraine, she experienced firsthand the dark side of socialism. Living through this molded her conservative political philosophy: limited government is always better, and financial and healthcare decisions should be made by individuals in the free market, not bureaucrats and special interests.

Victoria is a natural leader who has a proven track record in the business world, civic organizations and the public sector.

PO BOX 505 NOBLESVILLE, IN 46061

In many ways, she embodies the American Dream: born overseas, immigrating to the United States 20 years ago after meeting her husband, a born and raised Hoosier, on a train in Europe, becoming a US Citizen, and working her way up from bank teller to a CPA, finance executive and successful business owner.
