 <tag> p




Seniors are an important part of our community -- and everybody should have the ability to retire with dignity. I will always protect Social Security and fight to expand benefits. I will also do everything I can to lower prescription drug costs, including giving Medicare and Medicaid the ability to negotiate lower prices on behalf of our seniors.

I will fight to overturn Trump's tax plan which raised taxes on middle-class families, slashed funding for Medicare and increased our nation’s debt. I believe that what Americans need is tax reform that makes wealthy corporations pay their fair share and cuts taxes for the middle-class and small businesses.

Equality under the law must apply to all of us, not just some of us. I will be at the forefront of the fight to end discrimination in schools and the workplace. No person should be turned away from healthcare, housing or other services due to prejudice.

Healthcare is a human right. That is why I will fight for a Medicare for All system and will stand up to the Trump efforts to gut protections for pre-existing conditions. No American should ever go bankrupt due to healthcare costs.

I will never accept a dime from the gun lobby and I will work to pass commonsense laws to keep our schools and communities safe. I support a ban on assault weapons, mandatory background checks on all gun sales, and a healthcare system that provides comprehensive mental health treatment.

I believe that quality public education is the bedrock of the American dream. I support investment in public education, expanding early childhood education and making college more affordable so that every student who works hard can graduate from California's great public colleges and universities debt-free.

I will fight any efforts by Republicans to defund Planned Parenthood, restrict access to birth control, or ban the right to choose. Donald Trump’s Supreme Court pick represents a huge threat to women’s rights. Providing women with access to reproductive healthcare and birth control is not a luxury.

I have spent my entire career helping families stay in their homes by combating fraudulent lending practices. I am a strong advocate for using our tax code to encourage home ownership, and I support investments in programs that help first-time home buyers.

I understand the numerous challenges facing American households. Being able to take time off to care for your loved ones should not be one of those challenges. I will fight for the over 40 million people who currently provide unpaid care every year and help get them the support they need.

Our community values the environment and deserves a champion for our air, water, and beaches, not another vote for big oil. We must preserve this planet for our kids and the generations to come.

Our veterans make immense sacrifices to serve this country. That is why in Congress I will work to honor their service by ensuring they have access to great paying jobs, access to housing, and top-notch healthcare.

WHY I'M RUNNING

 <tag> p




The five banks had promised to help homeowners who had been harmed, and it was my job to hold the banks’ feet to the fire. My team won thousands of victories against the banks, forcing them to pay billions to families. And our work helped tens of thousands of families move forward with their lives.

“In Congress, I'll fight every day to make sure affordable, quality healthcare is accessible to all Americans.”

Before the housing bubble burst, Katie was one of the first to sound the alarm about Wall Street’s predatory practices targeting homeowners, winning recognition from the New York Times and many others.

“Donald Trump’s tax bill adds nearly $2 trillion to the deficit and special interest politicians in Congress now say they will cut Social Security and Medicare to pay for it. That’s just wrong. I’ll work to repeal this tax scam and pass real tax reform that helps Orange County families and small businesses.”

California families have a deep desire to move up the economic ladder and provide financial security for their loved ones. But too often, families who play by the rules still find themselves at the mercy of a system that favors powerful special interests who can buy influence in Washington.

"As a consumer advocate, I took on Wall Street during the housing crisis and won - saving billions for California homeowners. In Congress, I'll stand up to powerful special interests and leaders of both parties - starting with Donald Trump. I will always fight to protect Orange County taxpayers."

"I'm a UC Irvine law professor, mother of three, and consumer protection attorney. I took on Wall Street during the housing crisis and won - saving billions for California homeowners. In Congress, I'll stand up to powerful special interests and leaders of both parties - starting with Donald Trump. I will always put Orange County families first."

We need leaders in Congress who will stand up to corruption. I’m running again to continue the work I’ve always done – to take on the powerful special interests on behalf of our families. I hope you will join me!

“Southern California has some of the most beautiful coastline in the world, and we must protect it for future generations. That’s why I refuse to take a dime from oil companies. I will always protect Orange County's air, water, and beaches.”

But for so many families across the country, the harm had already been done. Politicians in Washington bailed out the banks in a matter of days, but middle-class families waited years for help from Washington — help that never came.

Katie is serving her second term representing California's 45th Congressional District where she's been a proven fighter for Orange County families. As a consumer protection attorney, Katie Porter has spent nearly twenty years fighting powerful interests and Wall Street banks on behalf of consumers and families. She’s a national leader in consumer protection and has won big victories against financial institutions who cheat consumers. She is now serving her first term in Congress where she is fighting for Orange County families and working Americans.

In 2012, then California Attorney General Kamala Harris appointed Katie to be California’s watchdog against the banks. The banks had promised to pay billions to homeowners they cheated, and Harris appointed Katie to make sure the banks followed through. Katie and her team held the banks’ feet to the fire, securing over $18 billion and helping tens of thousands of families move forward with their lives.

Much of my work as a consumer advocate has centered around the housing crisis that rocked Orange County and many other parts of the country. Before the crisis, I was one of the first to sound the alarm about how the biggest Wall Street banks were preying on homeowners. And when the crisis hit, I was appointed by Attorney General Kamala Harris to work directly with California families who were cheated by the five biggest Wall Street banks.

Eight years after the crash, Orange County families still find themselves stuck. Profits again are surging for financial institutions and Wall Street, but middle-class wages are stagnant. And the cost of things that matter most for families — affording preschool, sending your kid to college, saving for retirement — are skyrocketing, while the high cost of housing in Orange County is pushing families to the brink.

“I’ll stand up to Donald Trump and stand up to the NRA. I’ve spent nearly twenty years fighting powerful special interests... and winning. I will never take a dime from the gun lobby and will work to pass common-sense laws to keep our schools and communities safe.”

Katie’s is a mom to three wonderful children. They live in Irvine, where she is a long-time Cubmaster in her sons’ cub scout pack. Katie is a tenured Professor of Law at University of California Irvine and teaches consumer law.

I’m running for Congress to continue to hold the powerful special interests in Washington accountable on behalf of Orange County families. I will continue to stand with Orange County families 100% of the time.

As an advocate, Katie has sought reforms that help families get a fair shake in our economy. She has been a key player in the fight against abusive credit card fees and, in 2010, helped pass important federal credit card protections for families. She has written three books that document how Washington special interests skew our laws and cut off the legal rights of families who play by the rules.
