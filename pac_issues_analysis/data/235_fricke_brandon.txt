Enough with career politicians. Holding elected office was NEVER meant to be a career, it was meant to be a service to the constituents of your district. I promise to not serve more than three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Learn More

It is imperative that we give the men and women of the U.S. Border Patrol the resources they need to do their job more efficiently and effectively. Politicians in Washington DC need to stop grandstanding and START listening! Learn More

As our next Congressman, Brandon will restore representative leadership to the 33rd District, put partisanship aside, shake up the broken system, vote to preserve, promote, and extend freedom, and work to solve problems rather than mask them so hard-working American families can thrive and prosper.

Brandon Fricke is an independent candidate running to represent the people of California's beautiful 33rd Congressional District. Brandon's love for his community and frustration at seeing friends, family members and local businesses forced out while simultaneously watching the community become overrun by homelessness, trash, drugs and crime is what drove him to challenge Ted Lieu and put an end to the failed policies that are destroying not just coastal Los Angeles, but communities all over the nation.

We in California need to demand that our tax dollars stay here instead of being spent irresponsibly in Washington DC and around the country. Washington DC has a spending problem. Our national debt is over $22.5 Trillion, yet both parties argue over the percentage that we must increase spending each year instead of the percentage that we must reduce spending. There isn’t a private citizen or a business in this country that can be as irresponsible as our elected officials have been with OUR hard-earned tax dollars. The more debt we take on today, the less FREEDOM we all have as citizens tomorrow.

The following issues are the pillars of Brandon’s campaign.

It is imperative that we give the men and women of the U.S. Border Patrol the resources they need to do their job more efficiently and effectively. Politicians sitting in air-conditioned offices in Washington DC need to stop grandstanding and START listening! In addition to securing our border we have an obligation as a nation to fix our broken asylum laws. The world has taken advantage of America’s compassion. After helping our disadvantaged citizens, we should strive to help those with legitimate claims of asylum, but they must first be verified.

Enough with career politicians. Holding elected office was NEVER meant to be a career, it was meant to be a service to the constituents of your district. I promise to not serve more than three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, and I will hold a minimum of 24 in person town halls across the district per year. California’s 33rd District deserves a representative who understands the problems facing all constituents, not just the donor class. I will be invested and accountable to provide true solutions to our district’s problems. I will judge myself by the results of my policies, not the amount of money spent.

which only motivated him to prove otherwise.

In late 2017, Brandon met Tomi Lahren, his now-fiancée, in Hermosa Beach.

Throughout his youth he was told he was too short, too slow, and too scrawny to achieve his dream of playing D-1 college football

After subsequently completing a Master’s in Management from the WP Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, Brandon became a certified NFL agent.

Out of high school, Brandon attended Grossmont Community College in El Cajon, where he played football and eventually earned a full scholarship as a quarterback to Central Michigan University. There, he majored in sports management, setting him on the path to become an NFL Agent.

Brandon Fricke is an independent candidate running to represent the people of California’s beautiful 33rd Congressional District.

Additionally, Brandon also turned his sights to entrepreneurship, turning a joke with his fiancée into a successful E-commerce store.

Brandon’s love for his community and frustration at seeing friends, family members and local businesses forced out while simultaneously watching the community become overrun by homelessness, trash, drugs and crime is what drove him to challenge Ted Lieu and put an end to the failed policies that are destroying not just coastal Los Angeles, but communities all over the nation.

As our next Congressman, Brandon will restore representative leadership to the 33rd District, put partisanship aside, shake up the broken system, vote to preserve, promote, and extend freedom, and work to solve problems rather than mask them so hard-working American families can thrive and prosper.

In late 2017, Brandon met Tomi Lahren, his now-fiancée, in Hermosa Beach. The two became engaged during the Summer of 2019. They proudly call the South Bay home and look forward to continuing to call it home as they grow and raise a family and work to improve their community.

Brandon, the oldest of three children, grew up in Chico, California where he attended and played football at Pleasant Valley High School until transferring his senior year to Simi Valley High School where he started at quarterback. Throughout his youth he was told he was too short, too slow, and too scrawny to achieve his dream of playing D-1 college football – which only motivated him to prove otherwise.

After subsequently completing a Master’s in Management from the WP Carey School of Business at Arizona State University, Brandon became a certified NFL agent. Two and a half years later, at the age of 26, he became one of the youngest agents to sign and represent a Top-10 NFL Draft pick.
