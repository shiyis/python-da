About Jim

Jim knows we have to make health care more affordable and accessible to every Arkansan, which begins with the way medicine is delivered.

Jim knows it is not enough to simply believe in and talk good policy; you must also put in the work to get it done. Jim is known best for tackling the state's problems with common sense, conservative solutions. Bound by the time-tested principles of individual liberty, limited government, and responsible fiscal discipline, Jim has lead the push to make those principles a policy reality. (Read More)

In 2019, he was elected by his colleagues to be Senate President. Since being elected, Jim has fought to deliver results for hardworking Arkansas Taxpayers.

Senator Hendren has been a leading advocate for lowering taxes on hardworking Arkansans. Prior to his election, the Legislature raised taxes nearly every single session. Jim worked to change that trend.

Government can't do everything, but it is essential that government gets the fundamentals RIGHT - our safety net, infrastructure, security, education, property rights and protecting our freedoms.

HOME

Senator Hendren was honorably discharged from the U.S. Air Force and retired from the Arkansas Air National Guard. Images do not imply endorsements by the Department of Defense or any Service Branch.

Jim credits his parents for instilling the values of hard work, sacrifice, and sense of duty to serve our country. It was that sense of duty that led Jim to join the U.S. Air Force, where he served 8 years of active duty, completing his service at Elmendorf AFB in Alaska. After 9-11, he felt compelled to find a way to serve his country again. He found the opportunity to serve again when he joined the Missouri Air National Guard in 2003. There he served as the Offensive Duty Officer for the 157 Air Operations Group. He later joined the Arkansas Air National Guard, from which he retired at the rank of Colonel in the fall of 2019.
