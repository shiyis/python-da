For the last 4 years, I have fought in the trenches on their behalf with President Trump, Vice President Pence and fellow conservatives to empower families, value life and protect our constitutional liberties.

Hernando Sun: Get to Know US Rep District 11 incumbent candidate Daniel Webster (REP)

Experience gives Webster edge in race

 <tag> p




Congressman Daniel Webster is a successful small business owner, father of six, grandfather of thirteen, and active member of his church and community.

He currently sits on three House committees in the 115th Congress: House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House Committee on Natural Resources and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

“This bill is a commonsense solution that allows us to both enforce our laws and show compassion to families by not separating children from the loving arms of their parents,” said Webster. “It ensures the abuse of the law under ‘Catch and Release’ ends and individuals are not incentivized to use children as shields against prosecution for illegal border crossing,” he surmises.

During his tenure in office, he has proven himself to be a true statesman, standing by his principles and steadily advancing conservative values. As the state House Republican Leader in the 1990s, Webster engineered the successful Republican takeover of 1996, ending 122 years of Democrat control and becoming the first GOP Speaker of the House in over a century.

Webster said that principles should play a bigger role in the legislative process, rather than the accumulation of power and control.

Webster makes frequent visits to Hernando County to meet with community and school groups as well as leaders in business and local government.

Webster along with several other Representatives introduced the Keep Families Together and Enforce the Law Act in June. According to Webster’s office, “The bill protects the integrity of our immigration laws while ensuring that parents and children remain together during their legal proceedings.

Upon introducing the bill in March of this year with Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-IL), Webster remarked, “The Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act expands on the time-tested I-Corps program through adding a course for commercialization-ready participants... The NSF’s I-Corps program will bridge the divide between the academic world and commercialization sphere, playing a critical role in the efforts to increase innovation for all Americans.”

Mr. Webster graduated from Georgia Tech as an Electrical Engineer. He worked in his family's air conditioning business, helping it to grow.

In May, Webster introduced the Good Samaritan Charitable Physicians Services Act which will provide a tax deduction to healthcare providers for pro-bono health services to low-income individuals and families who rely on Medicaid or CHIP.

Rep. Daniel Webster remarked, “This bill is a creative, commonsense solution that ensures our most vulnerable Americans have access to the care they need, from the doctor they choose, at a price they can afford.”

Mr. Webster ran for his first political office because his church purchased a lot next door for parking. The church was then informed that they would not be able to use this lot for parking. State laws prohibited them from using the parking lot for the church. Mr. Webster ran for state office and was elected to serve in the Florida House. He served there for several years, before running for the United States House of Representatives.

Webster says his educational background is very different than the work he does in the House of Representatives. When he took exams, Webster explained, there was only one right answer. As a lawmaker, the right answer is not always so clear cut.

During a seven year period, Webster returned $2.9 million in taxpayer funds appropriated to run his office. He touts, “Washington operates on the principle that if money is appropriated, it should be spent. During my service in Congress, I have exposed this flawed principle. If every area of the federal government began intentionally cutting waste, we could get a lot closer to balancing our budget and trimming the massive burden of debt that will be inherited by our children and grandchildren.”

In late September, Congress passed a bill to improve long-term care disaster preparedness co-introduced by Webster and Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Michigan). “The bill is a much needed first step to ensuring that hospitals and long-term care facilities are more resilient against natural disasters,” said Webster.

Among recent bills he has introduced is the Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act of 2018 which expands the Innovation Corps program. The Innovation Corps program, known as I-Corps, was created by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2011 to teach scientists and engineers how to turn their laboratory innovations into successful commercial products and services.

In August, President Trump signed the Small Business Cybersecurity Bill, introduced by Webster last year. “This bill will provide small businesses in my district, state and across the country with the tools they need to meet the threats and challenges of the modern world,” said Rep. Webster. “These small businesses are more susceptible to attacks due to the limited access to the tools they need to prepare for such an event.”

He is fiscally conservative and has returned about $3 million in seven years from his office budget.

Cottrell is articulate and has done her research on the issues. But in this day and age, research is not enough. A candidate needs to build a backing.

Webster said Florida’s environment is sensitive and he is against offshore drilling in the Gulf. His environmental efforts earned him the Florida Audubon Everglades Award last year. He does, however, favor the roll back of the “Waters of the United States” rule, which helps determine what waterways would be protected under federal law, calling it unconstitutional. He also received failing grades from many environmental groups, according to Vote Smart Facts Matter, an Internet organization that records lawmakers’ votes.

“This bill is a commonsense solution that allows us to both enforce our laws and show compassion to families by not separating children from the loving arms of their parents,” said Webster. “It ensures the abuse of the law under ‘Catch and Release’ ends and individuals are not incentivized to use children as shields against prosecution for illegal border crossing,” he surmises.

OUR OPINION: Vote Webster.

FIXING

Webster, 69, has been a member of the U.S. House of Representatives since 2011. District 11 represents Sumter, Citrus and Hernando counties as well as central Marion County and the northwest corner of Lake County. Before that, he served 28 years in the Florida Legislature.

In the contest for U.S. House District 11 between Republican incumbent Daniel Webster and Democrat challenger Dana Cottrell the Chronicle recommends Webster, who is the more experienced legislator and best represents the makeup of District 11.

He earned an engineering degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology and worked in his family’s air conditioning and heating business, which he now owns.

She favors a pathway to citizenship for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) individuals. DACA individuals are those who were brought illegally to the United States before they were 16 years old.

ENDORSEMENT

Cottrell, 49, is a former teacher and mother of a special-needs child. She earned a master’s degree in library and information sciences from the University of South Florida. She lives in Spring Hill.

She wants to ban assault rifles and bump stocks and wants to create a national gun registry. She also wants to make gun manufactures include a fingerprint identification system on all guns so the gun could identify and operate for only the owner.

While in the House, Webster has worked hard helping veterans receive benefits and has made that a top priority. He recently supported a VA spending bill designed to facilitate health-care claims processing for thousands of veterans.

Webster has raised 10 times the money as Cottrell and has been at this for a long time. We urge Cottrell to continue her foray into politics and work to build a larger support group and political base for her next run at political office.

Cottrell is an advocate for the middle class — a voice she says has been forgotten in Washington. She is against off-shore drilling in the Gulf and believes the “Waters of the United States” rule should be left in place. Cottrell advocates for free college and trade school for academically qualified students.

Webster says his educational background is very different than the work he does in the House of Representatives. When he took exams, Webster explained, there was only one right answer. As a lawmaker, the right answer is not always so clear cut.
