 <tag> p




During his tenure in the Florida Senate, Lawson was named the “Dean of the Florida Legislature,” in recognition of his many years of service, and was elected Democratic Leader by his peers in 2012. The Florida Legislature named a portion of U.S. Highway 90 from the City of Midway to the City of Quincy as the “Alfred Lawson Jr. Highway” in his honor.

Congressman Lawson’s work ethic, problem-solving approach, and ability to build collaborative working relationships with his colleagues, regardless of political party, in Florida will serve him well in Washington, DC. As a dedicated public servant, Lawson begins each morning with a prayer, and a firm promise “to do the people’s work.” It is this simple philosophy that defines him as a man of character and substance that always keeps his promise.

Following a brief stint as a professional basketball player, Lawson became an assistant men’s basketball coach at Florida State. The highlight of his coaching career came in 1972 when the Seminoles reached the NCAA National Championship.

Lawson married his college sweetheart Delores Brooks, and they have two adult children, Alfred III and Shani. He is also the proud grandfather of Kobe, Samuel, Harlem, and Cameron Lawson.

Congressman Al Lawson is a committed public servant who brings a hard- working, problem-solving spirit to Congress and to the task of creating jobs, improving access to high-quality education from preschool through the post- secondary level and protecting working families. Elected in November 2016, and sworn-in January 3, 2017, Lawson represents Florida’s 5th Congressional District.

A native of Midway, Florida, Lawson graduated from Havana Northside High School, where he was a standout athlete, and received his Bachelor’s degree from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), where he lettered in basketball and ran track. Lawson went on to earn a Master’s degree in Public Administration from Florida State University and completed his course work for the Ph.D. in Public Administration.
