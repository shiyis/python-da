The people spreading these false claims have developed several high tools which they used to pass through the security of YouTube, which has made it more difficult. Also, YouTube isn't the only one facing such problems as other platforms like Facebook, Twitter and TikTok have continued to complain about these situations. YouTube has however remained the most consistent in removing these accounts.

However, the World Health agency has said there isn't any relationship between the drug and increasing rates of a blood clot. Also, the European medicine commission (EMA) said its review shows the occurrence is more of a chance, and the pros outweigh the cons. Nations like Bulgaria, Iceland, Thailand, and Denmark have already stopped the administration of the jab.

Due to these issues, there would be a slight delay in Vaccination procedures. The Dutch authorities have ordered about 11 doses of the Oxford drug with more than 260,000 expected to arrive next week. AstraZeneca has insisted that there is no evidence that its drugs cause a blood clot, and that recent discoveries may be a coincidence.

A security official was also killed last night after several Scuffles with protesters continued. The military Junta has continued to say it will leave power after a free and fair election must have been concluded this year. However, critics doubt they will do so since there are no guidelines.

'' It is important to ascertain that everything is 100% correct.''

Moreover, the average payout increases especially for private injuries and other home accidents, there is still a cut of 5% in payouts insurers made which was about £8.6 billion. Transport workers hope that these new savings will make for fewer premiums, however, this isn't so.

YouTube has begun moves to remove fake vaccine rumors from its platform. The video network has said it has removed about 32,000 videos to date for spreading fake vaccine news.

At least 40 people have been killed in the recent crackdown on demonstrators against the January coup in Burma. The military hierarchy has said there must be a martial curfew in regions like Yangon where various Chinese firms have been razed.

The association claims that most insurers have other costs they pay when they back customers. With few modes of transport going out due to the lockdown restrictions last year, this has had a huge impact on insurance, there were also fewer accidents and thefts noticed. However, there remain about 1.8 million claims to be settled, down by 20% last year.

According to amnesty intentionally 23 citizens were killed and more than 21 injured during the Scuffles. China's embassy has said its staff was injured and many of its goods were stolen by yet-to-be-identified hoodlums. Many residents of major cities can be seen bidding in their homes after several gunshots were heard and Military forces passed around.

The Sri Lanka government is considering banning the burqa and closing down Islamic schools. This it says is to stop religious extremism among minority Muslim groups.

In 2020, the government approved the cremation of all coronavirus victims which much Muslim faithful said was against their law. However, after intense lobbying from America and other NGOs, it was rescinded. Top Muslim rights fighter, Sheen Saroor said the minority Muslim population in the country was targeted.

"In times past, Islamic ladies never wore Burqa as it is a sign of extreme religious cases which shouldn't be encouraged.''

Insurance firms have also been affected by the COVID-19 issue as claims reduce. This is because most drivers have chosen to stay home due to lockdown protocols.

Several NGOs have said more than 2,000 people have been illegally arrested since the problem started. Fire and thick smoke can be seen near the industrial area of Hlaing Thar in Yangon. More than two firms belonging to China have been touched after the police opened last year's life rounds on protesters.

Transporters can also pay in lower installments than before. However, the probability that policies will get cheaper is possible as insurers try to make up for last year's claims. Transport workers have been urged to take advantage of the various benefits offered by insurers during this time before it increases.

The problems affecting the Oxford drug have continued as the Netherlands suspends drug administration. The government has said it is a precautionary decision.

'' In this country, nobody can just open any place and teach any knowledge, it must follow education policy. ''

This law allows the government to have powers to detain anyone suspected of terrorist activities for a minimum of one and a half years. According to Public security minister Sarath Weerasekera, that the government has approved a ban on the Burqa in the public.

Medical doctors have insisted that drugs and medical equipment are running low as casualties increase in major cities. They have called for an international intervention to stop the massacre.

The death toll in Myanmar has continued to rise as security officers clamp down on protesters. This action has resulted in multiple deaths with several casualties.

The popular streaming network said it has deleted more than 32,000 bogus coronavirus vaccination video claims on its platform. This, it said, has been going on for months, and it has promised to remove anyone who tries to stop a safe vaccination process going on in the world.

Also, he said he agreed to the banning of the burqa but the council of ministers and Sri Lanka parliament needs to sanction it before it becomes active. It will require a minimum of 75% of the parliament for the bill to be passed. Also, many Islamic institutions will be banned for not adhering to educational laws.

YouTube said in 2020, it has eradicated more than 850,000 videos on its platform for promoting COVID-19 fake information. These figures, it says cover more than jabs, but also various spurious claims about health and the virus itself. Some claims say that it affects fertility in men and women, and has a microchip amongst others. These claims have been debunked by the relevant health authorities.

The Dutch authorities are now the latest nation to ban the Oxford Drug in Europe after concerns about side - effects of clots. This move was taken as a precaution till at least April 28. Ireland was the first country to ban taking the jab before Norway followed suit last week.

The price of fresh comprehensive policy only declined by 1.2% mainly because of the low sales caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Also, notices are alterations by some insurers on some policies that have few mileages which consist of some rebates. Some extra incentives have also been initiated which include free charges for those transporting health drugs and those going to work.

It says its doctors are constantly checked for any anomalies but has found nothing. It noted that though there are various side effects of the drug, blood clotting isn't part of them. They have continuously been backed by various international health agencies and have continued to supply several nations. They would hope this matter will be solved soon.

A spokesperson for the streaming platform said such videos went against the data given out by the World Health Organization and Top agencies like NHS. The statement also confirmed that it banned various vaccine information while trying to stop attempts at maligning the good vaccination process.

According to the statement released by the government, this decision was more of a precaution than reactive. '' We want to avoid any problems with vaccinations, therefore this suspension is just temporary. '' Minister of health Hugo de Jonge said.

During the first wave of the virus, YouTube says that its platform has become a haven to the COVID-19 diseases while some claim it doesn't have cured. Despite its reservations on these fake videos, it isn't finding it easy deleting such accounts as there have been various accusations and counter-claims.

About a total of 125 people have died in violent crackdowns since the protest started according to the Assistance Association of political prisoners. The association has also warned that these figures are increasing daily except measures were put in place to stop it.

Insurance claims on vehicles being settled have declined drastically by 20% as many motors stay inactive at home. Also, the figures shelled are put pummeled 5% when compared to the last year figures according to the association of British Insurers. Also, noted that the general rates paid for fresh vehicle policy fell by 2%.

The Sri Lankan government has insisted it will ban using burqa, which is a body covering which covers the face. The government has also indicated plans to close more than 1,100 Islamic institutions which Muslim citizens claim were an attack on their rights.

At least 40 people have been killed in the recent crackdown on demonstrators against the January coup in Burma. The military hierarchy has said there must be a martial curfew in regions like Yangon where various Chinese firms have been razed.

Several NGOs have said more than 2,000 people have been illegally arrested since the problem started. Fire and thick smoke can be seen near the industrial area of Hlaing Thar in Yangon. More than two firms belonging to China have been touched after the police opened last year's life rounds on protesters.

According to amnesty intentionally 23 citizens were killed and more than 21 injured during the Scuffles. China's embassy has said its staff was injured and many of its goods were stolen by yet-to-be-identified hoodlums. Many residents of major cities can be seen bidding in their homes after several gunshots were heard and Military forces passed around.

The Sri Lanka government is considering banning the burqa and closing down Islamic schools. This it says is to stop religious extremism among minority Muslim groups.

In 2020, the government approved the cremation of all coronavirus victims which much Muslim faithful said was against their law. However, after intense lobbying from America and other NGOs, it was rescinded. Top Muslim rights fighter, Sheen Saroor said the minority Muslim population in the country was targeted.

"In times past, Islamic ladies never wore Burqa as it is a sign of extreme religious cases which shouldn't be encouraged.''

'' In this country, nobody can just open any place and teach any knowledge, it must follow education policy. ''

This law allows the government to have powers to detain anyone suspected of terrorist activities for a minimum of one and a half years. According to Public security minister Sarath Weerasekera, that the government has approved a ban on the Burqa in the public.

The Sri Lankan government has insisted it will ban using burqa, which is a body covering which covers the face. The government has also indicated plans to close more than 1,100 Islamic institutions which Muslim citizens claim were an attack on their rights. During the weekend, Sri Lankan authorities announced that it has activated an anti-terrorism act that will deal with any measures of Muslim extremism which has increased in the country.

The people spreading these false claims have developed several high tools which they used to pass through the security of YouTube, which has made it more difficult. Also, YouTube isn't the only one facing such problems as other platforms like Facebook, Twitter and TikTok have continued to complain about these situations. YouTube has however remained the most consistent in removing these accounts.

YouTube said in 2020, it has eradicated more than 850,000 videos on its platform for promoting COVID-19 fake information. These figures, it says cover more than jabs, but also various spurious claims about health and the virus itself. Some claims say that it affects fertility in men and women, and has a microchip amongst others. These claims have been debunked by the relevant health authorities.

A spokesperson for the streaming platform said such videos went against the data given out by the World Health Organization and Top agencies like NHS. The statement also confirmed that it banned various vaccine information while trying to stop attempts at maligning the good vaccination process.

During the first wave of the virus, YouTube says that its platform has become a haven to the COVID-19 diseases while some claim it doesn't have cured. Despite its reservations on these fake videos, it isn't finding it easy deleting such accounts as there have been various accusations and counter-claims.

The popular streaming network said it has deleted more than 32,000 bogus coronavirus vaccination video claims on its platform. This, it said, has been going on for months, and it has promised to remove anyone who tries to stop a safe vaccination process going on in the world.
