If you haven’t already heard it, check out this fantastic performance by Lynzy Lab, who offers an important perspective on the past few weeks. Great song with a critical message.

In becoming the party of Trump, the Republicans have forsaken traditional conservatism and given voters no rational alternative to the Democrats. The party needs to be voted out of power and spend a few years becoming again the party of Lincoln, not the party of Trump.

The congressmen, a big defense player, voted on the allocations Thursday.

Washington – The House Armed Services Committee has moved to boost submarine construction, which would allow Electric Boat to build an additional Virginia-class sub in each of the years 2020, 2022 and 2023. The planned increase in submarine production is part of the proposed sea power section of the 2018 House Defense Authorization bill that […]

Our region got great news earlier this year, when Electric Boat leaders projected 1,500 new hires in 2016 and 4,000 new workers over the next decade to meet the growing demand for new submarine construction. This did not happen overnight – Joe Courtney has been fighting since his first day in Congress to make sure that our nation invested in our critical submarine force, and the industrial base that builds it. Learn more about Joe’s work.

By: Russell Blair Rep. Joe Courtney, a member of the House’s education committee, is pressing his Republican colleagues to hold hearings on preventing school shootings in the wake of the massacre that left 17 dead at a Florida high school. “Something is deeply wrong in our society when we experience routine massacres, but we take […]

Courtney, who recently underwent hip replacement surgery, told the large […]

A House Republican plan to eliminate a $95-million-a-year federal apprenticeship program could be bad news for Connecticut. With a growing demand for skilled defense and aerospace workers, business and political leaders have been anticipating the funding to boost worker training ahead of an expected ramp-up in military contracting. “It just flies in the face of […]

There were many people who assisted UCFS in achieving this designation but I would like to indicate the extraordinary work done by Congressman Joe Courtney and his staff. Congressman Courtney worked with the Department of Health and Human Services. He placed calls, made visits and wrote letters and emails.

KABUL, Afghanistan — Six female students from war-torn Afghanistan who had hoped to participate in an international robotics competition in the United States this month will have to watch via video link after their visas were denied not once, but twice. The girls wanted to show the world that Afghans can also construct a hand-made […]

By: Rep. Joe Courtney As we enter the second year of the Trump administration, the president’s inability to advance a firm, coherent U.S. position toward Russia persists despite a torrent of belligerent behavior by the Kremlin toward the West. Indeed, on the day he announced a new national security strategy that purported to challenge Russia, […]

Of the remarkable things we have learned this election year, the most significant is that the current Republican Party is unfit to lead the country. It has failed the greatest test a political leader or party can face, and failed spectacularly.

“This grant funding is good news for our local fire departments that can use these federal funds to purchase life-saving equipment for their firefighters,” Courtney said in a statement. “Our [first responders] put their lives on the line each and every day to protect our homes and our communities, and we need to make sure we are doing everything we can to provide them with the appropriate equipment to keep them safe.”

By Michael Schere Former President Obama on Friday delivered a blistering criticism of the political tactics of his successor President Trump, saying he had built on the fears of the powerful as they look to diminishing importance in a rapidly changing nation. “It did not start with Donald Trump,” Obama said during a noon speech […]

Hiring at Electric Boat is expected to spur more work among suppliers, and manufacturers in Eastern Connecticut are organized to capitalize on job growth. The Eastern Advanced Manufacturing Alliance is working with Three Rivers and Quinebaug Valley community colleges and area technical high schools to “make sure what is taught at colleges is what industry wants,” Vallieres said.

Most Americans want Congress to set aside politics and search for common-sense solutions that build upon the efforts of the Affordable Care Act rather than tear it down with no viable alternative. The “Medicare Buy-In and Health Care Stabilization Act,” to be introduced by U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney and two other congressmen, is such a common-sense proposal. Courtney, […]

Courtney’s tireless work ethic, intellectual vigor and sound legislative judgment have enabled him to represent the vast 2nd District ably and comprehensively.

U.S. agriculture secretary isn’t interested in finding ways to help small farms survive. Farmers have enough problems without having to deal with a U.S. agriculture secretary whose lack of concern for them is appallingly apparent. Earlier this week, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue visited a dairy expo in Wisconsin, where farmers are hurting badly. When asked […]

The National Defense Authorization Act approved by the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday is good news for this region, with its funding for expedited attack submarine construction over the next several years and its commitment to a new generation of ballistic missile submarines. The legislation also lays the groundwork for more submarine repair work […]

In the midst of the worst economic recession of our time, it is just plain cruel to try and pull the floor out from under Americans’ retirement. For two-thirds of Social Security beneficiaries, Social Security makes up the majority of their retirement income. As 401(k)s fluctuate, Social Security remains strong. It has never missed a payment. Unless the Republicans have their way.

FEBRUARY 14, 2018 JOHN STEARNS Congressional approval of an extension for the federal Medicare Dependent Hospital Program (MDH) last week will result in about $3.8 million more in annual reimbursements for Windham Hospital, the only MDH hospital in Connecticut, according to an announcement this week from U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney and Hartford HealthCare, Windham’s parent.The […]

“I am committed to investigating every possible source of federal assistance that could be available to homeowners in northeastern Connecticut with crumbling foundations,” Courtney said. “As more and more residents are discovering that their homes may be impacted by this problem, we are going to need an all-hands-on-deck response in order to make these homeowners whole again.”

“I think Joe is laser-focused on Connecticut and the district,” said Cathy Osten, a Democratic state senator and first selectman of Sprague, the tiny town north of Norwich. “His non-political way of doing things … people listen to that.”

Kamala Harris brings a solid record and experience to the ticket as Attorney General and Senator that will resonate across the nation. Let’s get to work and win this critical election.

GREGORY B. HLADKY ghladky@courant.com A GOP-sponsored bill to revise federal student loan programs would shatter the hopes thousands of Connecticut college students, U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2, and a group of students warned Friday. Courtney said the ultimate fate of the bill that passed the U.S. House Education & Workforce Committee on a party-line vote this […]

A college education is one of the most valuable investments a family can make, but rising costs have made it difficult to afford. Joe knows how important it is to combat growing student loan debt to help students and middle-class families.

By Eric Bedner Journal Inquirer Feb 8, 2018 The IRS has determined that homeowners who make repairs to their crumbling foundations within the next three years can amend their 2017 federal tax filings to deduct the cost.

By Ryan Blessing NORWICH — It was more than a usual day for the students at Thomas W. Mahan Elementary School on Monday, when U.S. Rep.

By: ANA RADELAT | February 9, 2018 Washington – In rare bipartisan agreement, Congress on Friday approved a massive budget deal that will increase federal spending in Connecticut, providing big boosts for the state’s defense industry and health care programs and even helping schools educate displaced students from Puerto Rico. The budget deal increases both […]

EB hosted the event in response to an increased workforce demand not seen in years at the Groton shipbuilding company. The company is hiring thousands of workers to fill positions as engineers, machinists, carpenters, painters, welders and administrative roles as the U.S. military strategy turns back to submarines. As many as 850 high-skilled manufacturing and other jobs are being filled this year and an estimated 4,000 in the next 15 years, creating a workforce of 18,000 at the Groton and Quonset Point, R.I., sites. Between 275 and 300 employees retire each year at EB.

By: Matt Pilon U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney said he and a Vermont colleague have introduced legislation in Congress aimed at easing the cost of managing nuclear waste for communities such as Haddam.

Community health centers — including many located in area schools and providing health, dental, and behavioral care to East Hartford, Manchester, and Vernon residents — soon could see a sudden reduction in services if federal funds aren’t restored, local and congressional officials warn. Eugene Market, president and CEO of the nonprofit First Choice Health Centers, […]

Congressman Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, on Monday afternoon endorsed Ned Lamont for governor, because of Lamont’s focus on improving training for the state’s workforce.

The conference committee to which Courtney and Esty were appointed will be charged with combining the House and Senate bills into a single piece of legislation that can be sent to the president and signed into law, according to the news release.

House Democrats are poised to advance a flood of proposals designed to address the problems dogging President Obama’s signature healthcare law — a move that puts pressure on Republican and Democratic leaders alike. The strategy marks a pivot for the Democrats, as party leaders have throughout the year discouraged members from offering improvements to the […]

Congressman Joe Courtney (D-CT), ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee’s Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee, said in an interview with The National Interest that the ORP will be built, but it has be built without wrecking the rest of the Navy’s shipbuilding budget. “The Ohio Replacement Program—given where it stands in the food chain—I think it’s going to be built no matter what,” Courtney said. “It’s pretty much chiseled in stone. The question is how can we do it in an affordable way and how can we do it without suffocating the rest of the shipbuilding account.”

DECEMBER 27, 2017 • KAREN DEMASTERS The difference between being labeled an inpatient or outpatient may seem minor when you are lying in a hospital bed, but it can cost a patient big money in the end. This difference is something financial advisors should be aware of and warn their clients about when they enter […]

Driving the development in large part is the growing number of engineers and other well-paid professionals working at the Electric Boat offices in the city, thanks to the accelerated submarine building and design schedule U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, has fought for in the defense budget.

Courtney was one of 10 congressmen to send a scathing letter to the president.

Attention Mr. Grassley, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Corker, Mr. Graham, Mr. Cornyn and Mr. 46 minus 1: this is Mr. Merrick Garland. Remember him. You held his Supreme Court nomination open for 293 days without a single hearing. During those 293 days, no one came forward with a shred of evidence about anything that would disqualify him. You just didn’t schedule a hearing or vote for purely political reasons.

Reps. Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., and Joe Courtney, D-Conn., today introduced a bill that would allow schools to offer low-fat flavored milk with no more than 150 calories per 8-ounce serving as well as fat-free flavored milk in the federal school lunch and breakfast programs. The bill allows individual schools and school districts to determine which […]

The final GOP holdouts to Donald Trump whimper into oblivion. By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE Put a blond combover on the elephant. Take down the pictures of Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. It’s over.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Congressman Joe Courtney announced Tuesday that Connecticut Sea Grant has been awarded nearly $470,500 in federal funding.

81 years ago, Social Security was born out of a commitment to make sure that older americans were not relegated to a live of poverty. In the years since we have built on that commitment, ensuring that hard-working Americans that pay in to Social Security have financial security they deserve when they retire.

Under a new bill, a handful of new drugs might never get produced. That would be worth it. The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. A bill now making its way through the House could finally provide relief […]

Thanks to Rep. Courtney’s efforts, there is reason to be optimistic about our state’s economic prospects.

“It’s fun seeing this, it’s a transformation for the area.” Courtney said. “This is a poster child for how the USDA can help eastern Connecticut, because we are the most rural, sparsely populated area and it’s hard to finance projects like this because of that characteristic.”

By Martha Shanahan Day staff writer m.shanahan@theday.com Connecticut Sea Grant, one of 33 university-based programs nationwide funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, is facing its second defunding threat in two years after President Donald Trump proposed eliminating Sea Grant in his 2019 budget proposal. Trump’s budget, released Monday, would eliminate funding for what his […]

HARTFORD, Conn. (WTNH)– Congressman Joe Courtney spoke against the contribution President Trump’s budget plan would have on the student loan debt crisis.

U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat from Manhattan and the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, has offered up a straight-forward piece of legislation, co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, which would put an end to the practice.

Today, Courtney for Congress donated $2,000 equality split among five eastern Connecticut food banks and charities as families in the region recover from last week’s widespread power outages.

The upswing at Electric Boat will be felt in Groton and New London and it will ripple across our state, in hundreds of small businesses and skilled manufacturing firms that support the work at the shipyard. This is welcome news for our state, which has had its confidence shaken in the past year, and left many doubting our competitive posture in the global economy.

Washington — Bowing to local pressure, the Federal Railroad Administration has dropped plans for a controversial new rail line along the eastern Connecticut shore from its ambitious project to overhaul the railroad system in the Northeast corridor.

On Aug. 25 NIST awarded UConn $768,000 to conduct further research into the effects of pyrrhotite on concrete and what quantity of pyrrhotite poses a danger to a foundation’s integrity. Will trace amounts lead to failure? There are so many variables. We need answers.

William Tong and Joe Courtney Connecticut residents owe $17 billion in student loan debt — averaging over $31,000 per borrower. That is a crushing debt load with serious implications for anyone looking to start a family, open a business, or buy a home. These are not merely statistics to us. They are the stories we […]

Since entering office in 2006 during the closing years of the George W. Bush administration, Courtney has pushed the case to ramp up submarine construction. He has had much success. Electric Boat in Groton is now working on a two submarines per year construction schedule. While a proposal to build three Virginia-class attack submarines in 2022 and 2023 suffered a procedural setback this year, Courtney is undaunted and plans to renew his arguments for expedited construction if re-elected.

Even in a deeply partisan Congress that has set records for inactivity, and despite being a member of the minority party in the House of Representatives, U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney has proved to be an effective congressman for the 2nd Congressional District that covers the eastern half of Connecticut.

Connnecticut’s 2nd Congressional District, which takes up half the state, is a diverse place. From the southeastern shore to the Massachusetts border, the district includes rich and poor towns, universities and military bases, and a range of social issues. U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, 63, of Vernon, has done a good job meeting the needs of his many constituencies. Most of all, this Democrat has brought home defense jobs.

By Kristina Tedeschi Wayne For The Bulletin Posted Feb 21, 2018 at 2:44 PM NORWICH — U.S. Rep.

POSTED 1:03 PM, NOVEMBER 22, 2017, BY DOUG STEWART HARTFORD — Rep. Joe Courtney and Rep.

By: Stephen Singer Contact Reporter The president of submarine manufacturer Electric Boat delivered an upbeat outlook Monday, telling a business audience that hiring is up, more subs will be built and the Groton site will house new buildings to handle the increased work. Jeffrey Geiger, presenting the annual outlook for the subsidiary of General Dynamics Corp., […]

The House Armed Services seapower and projection forces subcommittee mark directs the Navy to purchase 13 ships in fiscal year 2018, which disregards the service’s initial request of eight vessels. Ranking Member Joe Courtney (D-CT) told Inside Defense June 20 the FY-18 budget sent from the White House is being “tossed to the side.” The […]

The Hartford Courant This is indeed “huge” news, to quote Connecticut congressman John Larson: The IRS will give a big tax break to homeowners with crumbling foundations. This couldn’t have happened without the dogged determination of U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, whose eastern Connecticut district has been hardest hit by the plague. It’s not often that liberal […]

“So far, we’ve done extremely well,” said Rep. Courtney, whose Connecticut district is home to growing sub-builder Electric Boat. In the administration’s budget request, he told me yesterday, “there was a little bit of a shortfall in AP (advanced procurement) funding for one of the submarines for next year, 2017…. $85 million… That’s going to be restored” in the HASC bill.

“We need to do everything we can to support our small farmers and local agriculture,” Courtney said. “It’s unfair that dairy farmers across the Northeast, including in Connecticut, are forced to calculate their feed costs based on averages that are heavily weighted toward Midwest farming operations.”

While some voters on the right will never be comfortable with Rep. Joe Courtney’s Democratic affiliation, it is hard to argue that he has not been getting the job done for his Second Congressional District, which encompasses most of the eastern half of Connecticut.

By: ANA RADELAT | November 8, 2017 Washington – Congressional negotiators on Wednesday finished work on a final defense bill that would boost the number of F-35’s requested by President Donald Trump from 70 to 90 and Sikorsky-made Black Hawk helicopters from 45 to 53. The defense bill also authorized billions of dollars for submarines […]

At Manchester Memorial Hospital Monday, Reps. John Larson and Joe Courtney proposed what they see as a common sense solution to the health care debate that has ensnarled Congress: a Medicare buy-in beginning at age 50.

As many as 9.6 million Americans could gain health insurance under Hillary Clinton’s proposal to provide families a tax credit to help them pay for premiums, deductibles and coinsurance, according to a new analysis.

Members of the National Guard and Reserves will be able to seek help for military sexual trauma through the Department of Veterans Affairs, if a proposal from U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, goes through. A technicality in an existing law prevents most members of the guard and reserves from using the military sexual trauma, […]

The GOP is out of time, and there is no reasonable alternative to continuing massive federal aid. Republicans must admit the obvious and get a bill passed, immediately.

by Christine Stuart | Nov 22, 2017 2:26pm HARTFORD, CT — Thanksgiving came early for thousands of Connecticut homeowners with crumbling foundations. That’s because the U.S. Treasury Department announced Wednesday that they will allow homeowners to deduct the cost of repairs to their homes from their federal taxes. U.S. Reps. Joe Courtney and John B. […]

Realtors for Connecticut PAC was formed and is run directly by the Connecticut Association of Realtors, which contributed all of its $604,420 in income. Last week the group endorsed Stefanowski, who will likely be the benefactor of most of that money in the coming days. The National Association of Realtors Fund has also spent $126,202.

The effort was spearheaded by Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn. In a statement, he said that “it should be (troops’) right to pass that hard-earned benefit over to a close family member such a child or a spouse.”

Washington – The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday approved a bill that would block the sale of Plum Island — a strip of land in Long Island Sound — to the highest bidder. The voice vote on the bill was a substantial win for environmentalists, conservationists and Connecticut lawmakers who want to preserve the island […]

The main GOP policy goals — cutting entitlements, cutting taxes for the rich and repealing protection for preexisting conditions — are extremely unpopular. (Republicans’ positions on climate change, “dreamers,” the wall and plenty else are also out of sync with voters.) In the final stretch before Election Day, Democrats are likely to remind voters of the GOP’s ambitions should they retain control of both houses. With many voters already saying they want a check on Trump, McConnell reiterated the policy stances that voters fear most. Schumer and his party couldn’t have asked for a better “October surprise.”

A generation removed from war, the children of William Gamache and Gerard Gonyea shared their fathers’ stories as they accepted their posthumous medals Wednesday afternoon at town hall. Gamache, who served in Europe during World War II, received more than a dozen medals, including a Bronze Star. Raven Reid, Gamache’s daughter, said she could always […]

Eastern Connecticut is also host to many examples of our vibrant culture, including Sailfest in New London, Willimantic’s Boom Box Parade, the Woodstock Fair, the Four Town Fair, the Hebron Harvest Fair and the Brooklyn Fair.

Eastern Connecticut also has a proud industrial history dating back more than 150 years. Thanks to its many rivers, there was once an abundance of water-powered textile mills during the Industrial Revolution. Willimantic, known as “Thread City,” was home to the American Thread Company from 1898 until the 1980s. In Stafford Springs, the Warren Mill had been operating for 160 years before closing its doors at the end of 2013. Fortunately, in June 2014 after assistance from Congressman Joe Courtney and the State of Connecticut, an investor was able to purchase that mill and reopen it in order to continue to produce fine wool for designer clothing brands.

History

Eastern Connecticut is also committed to educating its future workforce. The Eastern Connecticut Workforce Investment Board works with Quinebaug Valley Community College in Danielson and Willimantic, and Three Rivers Community College in Norwich to promote manufacturing as a career path for students. Asnuntuck Community College in Enfield also offers skilled manufacturing certificates and degrees at its manufacturing technology center. Eastern Connecticut takes pride in quality higher education, and in addition to these community colleges, the region is also home to the University of Connecticut, Eastern Connecticut State University, as well as Connecticut College, Mitchell College, and the United States Coast Guard Academy.

Today, Eastern Connecticut is still home to a thriving manufacturing sector supporting tens-of-thousands of jobs. For example, General Dynamics’ Electric Boat shipyard in Groton and New London employs over 11,000 skilled manufacturing workers and builds two Virginia-class submarines per year for the United States Navy. Work at the shipyard is also supported by more than 400 small and medium-sized parts suppliers across the district and the state.

Like much of New England, Eastern Connecticut is bursting with history from the birth of our nation to the present day. Governor Jonathan Trumbull, the only colonial governor to side with the Patriots at the start of the Revolutionary War, called Lebanon home. Coventry native Nathan Hale famously said, “I only regret that I have but one life to give for my country,” as he was hanged by British Forces in New York City after being captured while serving as an American spy. Samuel Huntington, a Connecticut delegate to the Continental Congress and signer of the Declaration of Independence was from Scotland. Gov. Trumbull’s son, also named John Trumbull, went on to achieve great success as a painter after the Revolutionary War and may be most well-known for his work, Declaration of Independence, which still hangs in the U.S. Capitol rotunda along with several of his other paintings.

With miles of shoreline on Long Island Sound including Hammonasset State Park in Madison, Ocean Beach in Waterford, and over 100 miles of scenic roads and spectacular autumn foliage, the environment in eastern Connecticut is a true highlight of the Second Congressional District.

Manufacturing

Culture

Eastern Connecticut has a rich agricultural heritage, with dairy farms still dotting the landscape. Today, the Farmer’s Cow is a group of six local, family-owned dairy farms in Franklin, Woodstock, Thompson, Lebanon, Coventry, and Hebron. Some of them have been operating since the 18th century, producing fresh, local milk and other dairy products that are shipped to grocery stores across the Second District and beyond.

Courtney for Congress

 <tag> p




Courtney is a 1975 graduate of Tufts University in Boston. He earned a law degree from the University of Connecticut School of Law in 1978. Courtney lives in Vernon with his wife, Audrey, a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner, and their two children, Robert and Elizabeth.

As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman Courtney has also fought to protect and strengthen eastern Connecticut’s status as the ‘Submarine Capital of the World’. When Courtney took office, for the first time in 50 years Electric Boat was not designing the next generation of submarines. Building just one submarine per year, the company was facing significant cutbacks, and the workforce — and regional economy — were in jeopardy.

Working with his colleagues in the Senate, Congressman Courtney has also fought for SUBASE New London, securing more than $80 million in new military construction at the base to ensure that New England’s largest military installation will thrive well into the 21st century.

In his first term, Courtney secured seed money for EB to begin design work on new subs, and in 2011, Electric Boat will build a second submarine in a year for the first time since the 1980s. Courtney’s work on submarines has boosted businesses in Groton and New London — where EB is moving into the old Pfizer research complex — and means additional work and hiring as far away as Enfield. For his work in increasing submarine production, Courtney was named the Legislator of the Year by the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers.

Courtney has always worked in a bipartisan manner to get things done for his constituents. Honored as the Democrat Most Admired by Republicans while a member of the Connecticut General Assembly, Courtney has applied that same style in Washington. He partnered with 2008 Republican Presidential nominee John McCain to introduce legislation to help veterans and active duty military continue their public service as public school teachers. He also joined forces with Republican Congressman Ken Calvert to extend the tax credit for first time homebuyers, an important catalyst for our national and regional economic recovery.

For his work on behalf of veterans, Courtney was awarded the Connecticut National Guard’s highest honor, the Meritorious Service Award. He has also earned the Connecticut VFW’s Legislator of the Year Award for 2009, the Patient Advocate Foundation’s Health Care Hero Award, and the Golden Triangle Award from the National Farmers’ Union for his efforts to protect the region’s dairy farmers and rural heritage.

Congressman Courtney has sliced through bureaucratic red tape, eliminating tariffs that have hurt local businesses and working to grow “Made in America” jobs. He was also the only member of the Connecticut Congressional delegation to vote against bailouts for major Wall Street banks. Courtney opposed the bailouts despite pressure from two presidents — one from each party — and sided instead with the working men and women of Connecticut.

Since his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006, Joe Courtney has served as an independent voice and tireless advocate for eastern Connecticut. Sent to Washington during the most trying economic period in a generation, Courtney has fought to protect jobs in the region and to expand opportunities for Connecticut businesses.

Prior to his election in 2006, Courtney represented Vernon in the 56th House District in the Connecticut General Assembly for four terms — from 1987 to 1994. During this tenure, he served as House Chairman for both the Public Health and Human Services Committees.
