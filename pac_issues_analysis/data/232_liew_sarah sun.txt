Complicating matters is that, at present, Congress continues to flail about and play politics instead of passing the stimulus relief package promised over the summer and should have passed months ago.

COVID IN CALIFORNIA: RESTORATION & RELIEF

In early 2020, the world was shocked by the COVID-19 threat. Soon foreign viruses arrived on our shores and began to disrupt our country, our economy, and our way of life. Unfortunately, our state turned out to be the hardest hit.

With over 24.2 M infections and 400k deaths(Date: 1/19/2021 Reported), the COVID crisis did inestimable damage to our state’s economy and infrastructure, with the restaurant and tourism sectors being among the hardest hit.

ISSUES & SOLUTION

There is simply no way California can hope to recover without direct, immediate intervention on behalf of California’s citizens. It will bring both the public and private sectors working together to restore our state and its economy to its former glory.

Seeking a spiritual renewal in our state. Our comeback from the COVID crisis will require more than simply curing the virus and repairing our schools and businesses. We need a spiritual recovery as well. This will require renewed effort from churches, charities, and non-profits, to restore a spiritually stagnant America. America is a religious nation, yet many churches have stopped long-term worship in light of the pandemic. The effects of this action on our communities have been completely deleterious in effect and done incalculable damage. As your representative, Dr. Liew, a pastor herself, will seek to revitalize the church and help it achieve its humanitarian, social, and economic mission.

Dr. Liew’s proposals for the revitalizing of California include:

As a successful businesswoman herself, with more than 30 years’ experience in the private sector, Dr. Liew proposes a complete overhaul of California’s social and legal structure to deal with the crisis at hand and aid in the recovery.

Targeted assistance for those in the tourism, restaurant, and hospitality sectors, to include relief for lost work and wages, as well as to encourage new business growth in said sectors, and more…
