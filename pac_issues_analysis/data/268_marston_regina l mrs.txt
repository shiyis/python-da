I believe it’s time to have a representative that will represent ALL of the constituents in District 42. I pledge to LISTEN. LEARN. AND ACT. on behalf of everyone in the region. My goal is to work for everyone, ensuring that no one is ignored, despite differences in political party, ideology, economic power, culture, or religion. I believe that public servants work for ALL the people and that YOUR interests are what really matters.
