I’m especially honored to be endorsed by Children’s Campaign Fund. CCF “provides a non-partisan, collective voice and means for the people of Washington state to elect leaders who will put kids first, and to hold them accountable for supporting the whole child.”

I’m extremely proud to have been named a “Guardian of Small Business” by the Washington chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business. NFIB is “the voice of small business, advocating on behalf of America’s small and independent business owners.”

I’m incredibly excited to receive the “City Champion Award” from the Association of Washington Cities. AWC represents all 281 of Washington’s cities and towns before the state legislature, the executive branch and state regulatory agencies….

In three terms in Olympia, state Rep. Drew Stokesbary has emerged as a sharp, energetic voice for a fast-growing suburban constituency. Voters in the 31st Legislative District have an easy choice to return the Auburn Republican to Olympia in the Aug. 4 primary.

For House Position 1, Stokesbary has excelled in his role promoting cautious state budgets for the minority party. He’s also a respectful foil for Gov. Jay Inslee and legislative Democrats.

Stokesbary showed continued support and dedication through the high-stakes discussions of the consumer data privacy legislation. He played an important role as the ranking minority member on the House Appropriations Committee and is always working hard to stop new taxes from impacting the business community.

My mom was a teacher in Washington State for 25 years, and her father was a teacher before that. My dad’s parents both taught at the Washington State School for the Deaf. Coming from a family of teachers, I’ve always understood the importance of quality education. I’m proud to have been endorsed by Public School Employees of Washington, the union representing 30,000+ educators and other K-12 school support professionals.

As a father of two young boys, I want good schools more than ever. Schools should have the resources they need to succeed, and we must ensure those resources are used wisely. That’s why I’ve been endorsed once again by Stand for Children, an organization that, like me, “strives to ensure that all children, regardless of their background, graduate high school prepared for, and with access to, college or career training.”

Since I was first elected in 2014, biennial state general fund spending was $33 billion. Now the budget has ballooned to well over $50 billion, an increase of nearly 70 percent increase in just six years. (Has your own household income risen by 70 percent since 2014?) With our economy struggling from coronavirus and the risk of a recession, or even a full-fledged depression, higher than ever, now is not the time to continue raising taxes.

I have served on the House Finance Committee for all three of my terms in the State House. There I have helped defeat tens of billions of dollars worth of new taxes proposed by the Governor and majority-party Democrats, including new or additional taxes on income you earn, energy you consume, bottled water you drink, services you hire professionals to perform, the house you sell, the car you trade in, and the things you buy on the internet.

When I was first elected to the Legislature in 2014, the state had already been held in “contempt of court” for failing to constitutionally fund K-12 public schools. A few months later, the Supreme Court ordered a $100,000 per day fine until education was fully funded. Through my work on the House Appropriations and Education Committees and other bipartisan negotiations, I’m proud to have helped create and pass landmark education funding reform legislation in 2017. The new system dramatically increased funding for Auburn, Enumclaw, Sumner, White River, Carbonado and Dieringer School Districts (while still reducing total property taxes for those districts starting next year), increases the accountability and transparency of your tax dollars, and ensures K-12 funds are spent on things that matter like textbooks and smaller class sizes.

Instead of more taxes, the Legislature needs to better prioritize state spending. As the chief budget writer for the House Republicans, I’ve worked hard to identify and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse, but far more remains to be done. We must also reform our state budget process to avoid committing to such large and rapid spending increases. I’ll continue pushing for these reforms if I’m re-elected.

As Washington recovers from this unprecedented public health crisis, I want to ensure the economy is opened quickly but safely and there is an opportunity for all Washingtonians to be successful. That’s why the latest idea out of Seattle, to levy a tax on businesses for employees they hire, is so misguided. In Olympia, I’ll continue to advocate for policies that grow the economy and create jobs, not ones that disincentive hiring.

Kids deserve our first dollar, not our last dime. I will continue be your advocate for better schools and better outcomes.

In addition, Rep. Stokesbary has sponsored or co-sponsored several other important bills to keep our communities safe:

In addition to the countless individuals and organizations who have endorsed his reelection campaign, Rep. Stokesbary’s hard work in the Legislature on behalf of the residents of the 31st District has earned special recognition by several groups:

Rep. Stokesbary has worked with senior legislators on both sides of the aisle to fund capital projects that make our neighborhoods a great place to live, work and raise a family:

Rep. Stokesbary has worked diligently to successfully obtain funding for several badly-needed transportation projects in our communities. These projects will decrease travel times, increase safety, and give families more time to spend together:

 <tag> p


He studied Economics and Mathematics at Duke University before returning home to Washington. He married his wife Ashley, moved to Auburn, and helped re-elect Rob McKenna as our attorney general. He and Ashley then moved to the midwest where Drew attended law school at the University of Notre Dame and graduated cum laude. After law school, Drew and Ashley returned home to Auburn and Drew spent several years working as policy aide for a King County Councilmember.

Drew has served as State Representative for three terms. In the Legislature, he serves on two standing committees, the Appropriations Committee (responsible for spending bills and the state operating budget) and Finance Committee (responsible for state tax policy). During his second term, he was elected into caucus leadership and rose to become the Minority Floor Leader. Prior to his third term, he was named the Ranking Member on the Appropriations Committee. He also sits on several outside committees, including the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee (responsible for examining the effectiveness of tax preferences), the Select Committee on Pension Policy (responsible for studying and recommending policies affecting the state’s public pension system), the Caseload Forecast Council (responsible for forecasting the entitlement caseloads for the state), the Pension Funding Council (responsible for setting economic assumptions and pension contribution rates for the state’s 11 pension plans), the Expenditure Limit Committee (responsible for determining and adjusting the state expenditure limit), and the Joint Committee on Employment Relations (responsible for consulting with the governor on matters related to collective bargaining with state employees).

Outside of the Legislature, Drew is a practicing attorney. He is the managing member of Stokesbary PLLC, a boutique law firm in Sumner that provides corporate law and securities counsel to startups and emerging companies in the Puget Sound region and across the country. Drew also founded and serves as president of the nonprofit organization Citizen Action Defense Fund, which is dedicated to sustaining, defending and providing the means to preserve the individual constitutional rights of all Washingtonians. In addition, he is a member of the Board of Directors of the Auburn Valley YMCA and the Office of Civil Legal Aid Oversight Committee.

Drew and Ashley have been married for 12 years, and they have two young sons, Jack (age 6) and Eli (age 4), and a hyperactive border collie puppy named Scout. When they’re not working, they enjoy hiking and camping throughout Washington.

Rep. Drew Stokesbary was born and raised in Washington state. He spent his childhood growing up in the shadow of Mt. Rainier and graduated from a local public high school.
