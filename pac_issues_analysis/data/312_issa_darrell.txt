BORDER AND IMMIGRATION

IMPEACHMENT

SECOND AMENDMENT

SANCTUARY CITIES

 <tag> p




As a Member of Congress, I earned a 100 percent voting record from the National Right to Life Committee – and a zero percent rating from Planned Parenthood. I voted to defund Planned Parenthood and supported numerous pro-life measures like the partial-birth abortion ban and the Pain Capable Unborn Child Act.

“The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.”

SECOND AMENDMENT

IMPEACHMENT

When San Diego’s US Attorney refused to prosecute human smugglers, I fought to provide more resources for prosecution and ultimately, because of my work, the President fired and replaced the US Attorney with one who would enforce the law.

Every life has value and we must protect those who aren’t able to protect themselves.

Democrats are doing everything they can to subvert the will of voters in the 2016 election. One prominent Democrat even said, “if we don’t’ impeach the president, he’ll get re-elected.”

In addition to border enforcement, I believe we must focus equally on interior enforcement, removing those who have overstayed visas and entered the country on false pretenses. The rule of law must be restored before Congress can work to reform our legal immigration laws.

I believe free trade is fair trade, but for too long, we’ve allowed our trading partners to take advantage of American workers. Our workers and businesses deserve a level playing field and the fair opportunity to compete. I supported the reduction in the corporate tax rate to make the United States competitive in the global market, to keep and create jobs in America and to encourage businesses to grow here at home.

Darrell Issa is a former member of the US Army. Use of his military rank, job titles, and photographs in uniform does not imply endorsement by the Department of the Army or the Department of Defense.

We need conservatives in Washington who know how to fight fire with fire. I’ve proven my ability to stand up to extremists. My work resulted in Eric Holder being held in contempt of Congress, Hillary Clinton being held accountable for the deaths of American diplomats and servicemen in Benghazi, and Barack Obama being held accountable for presiding over the Lois Lerner scandal. I led the recall of Governor Gray Davis for many of the same failures of leadership that we’re now seeing from Gavin Newsom.

BORDER AND IMMIGRATION

The government can’t protect us by taking away our rights. The framers of the Constitution gave us the right to free speech to as the first line of defense against a tyrannical government, and gave us the right to keep and bear arms as the last line of defense.

Sadly, both the First and Second Amendments are under attack today. I will fight to prevent all infringements of our Constitutional rights.

SANCTUARY CITIES

Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi have made it clear that they’ll use any excuse to remove the duly elected President of the United States from office. Impeachment should not be used as a tool for politicians to reverse the will of the American people.

You don’t have to wonder whether I’ll stand for life in Congress, because I have a solid Pro-Life voting record throughout my entire career in Congress. I have never supported government funding for abortions and I never will.

JOBS AND TRADE

I applaud the Trump administration and cities and counties throughout California, including San Diego County and the City of Escondido, for standing up to Sacramento and taking legal action to fight California’s Sanctuary State law in order to keep our communities safe. I will continue working with President Trump to fight this lawlessness and hold our elected leaders accountable for enforcing the law.

I will join our President in standing up to China and any other nation which seeks to dump undervalued goods on our markets, manipulate their currency to cheat American workers or steal the intellectual property of American innovators.

The wall also makes it possible to apprehend criminals crossing the border, particularly drug smugglers and human traffickers.

LIFE

We can’t keep our country safe if we don’t secure the border. For more than a decade, the Border Patrol has asked for the tools to do their job. The Border Wall is a powerful enforcement tool and a force multiplier. I visit with our Border Patrol agents frequently and they’ve shown me that a handful of agents can effectively patrol a mile of fenced border, while hundreds of agents are needed to patrol that same mile of open border.

My position on the border is simple: We must build the wall.

I support safe and responsible gun ownership. I’ve never received lower than an ‘A’ rating from the NRA and I have been a proud recipient of their endorsement. I was honored to speak at the NRA’s national convention detailing my work to hold Eric Holder accountable for his Fast and Furious “gun walking” scandal, which factored in the murder of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. Gun Owners of America called me a ‘Second Amendment Hero.’

Well known as a grassroots leader to Republicans throughout California, Darrell Issa is perhaps best known as the architect of the successful effort to recall former Gov. Gray Davis. He served as co-chair of the campaign to pass the California Civil Rights Initiative (Prop. 209) and was Chairman of the California Republican Party’s statewide Victory ’96 effort. He acted as Chairman of the Volunteer Committee for the 1996 Republican National Convention where he recruited and organized the activities of more than 10,000 volunteers. In 1998 he made a strong bid for United States Senate, narrowly losing a close race to then State Treasurer Matt Fong. After the election, Issa endorsed Fong and actively raised money for his campaign. He later became Chairman of the San Diego County Lincoln Club, an influential Republican organization.
