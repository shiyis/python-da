Carla is not just an exceptionally qualified leader, she is a uniter (not a divider), which is what we desperately need NOW.

I served in the military to protect our great citizens, then I served as a VA and Registered Nurse to protect our sick. I’m now running for Congress, so I can continue to serve YOU. You should be the priority, not foreign governments.

Florida’s 23rd Congressional District is currently occupied by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was first elected in 2004 (in the 20th District). She is the definition of a career politician who has virtually no experience in issues that we all face everyday in our jobs, business and communities. She has put politics above people, she has worked for the powerful not the people, she has sowed division not unity. She has failed us ALL.
