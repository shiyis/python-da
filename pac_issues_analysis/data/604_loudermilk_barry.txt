Barry’s Statement on Voting Against Impeachment:

Getting government out of the way…

 <tag> p




“Antifa actually sent some folks there to actually learn how the riot would respond to this,” he said. “Why? Because they’ve been committing multiple acts of violence throughout our nation throughout 2020.”

Loudermilk said his office did receive “advance notice of security threats” ahead of the Jan. 6 riots — albeit, purported threats from foreign actors. “In fact, Iran had threatened to attack the Capitol on the 6th, to avenge the death of Soleimani,” he said. “They’re actively investigating members of Congress, Pelosi is, for harboring the insurrectionists … I’m sure the fact that we actually had people from Bartow and Cherokee County up there, when they figure that out, I’m going to be one of those investigated.” During the riots, Loudermilk said two bombs were placed near the vicinity of his Washington, D.C. office. He urged a slow response from Republicans as investigations of the riot continues.

Almost three months later, however, Loudermilk said he still believes Trump was the “true” winner of last fall’s election.

“The election was hijacked,” he said. “I just retweeted what Nancy said.”

“We’re not supposed to mention those, because it’s different,” he said. “Those people are being oppressed by the government and they were justified in the action, even if they burned down someone’s business, which was devastating to them, or actually murdered someone who was trying to protect them.”

At a Bartow County Republican function on Jan. 30, Loudermilk said he met with several constituents who were in the nation’s capital for the now-infamous pro-Trump demonstration.

“It actually went up for a vote, 35 Democrats voted for the objection, including John Lewis of Georgia and Cynthia McKinney,” he said. “They accidentally left their names off of the article, that that’s an act of insurrection.”

He recalled hearing another loud noise during the break-in. “Immediately, all the Democrats jump up and they run out the back of the chambers as fast as they can go,” he said. “The three Republicans that I could see on the camera turned and they ran to the door … it was the different reaction, there was a flight and a fight reaction.” In the wake of the riots, Loudermilk said he believes Democrats are expecting Republicans to “lash out.”

Throughout his speech last week, Loudermilk made several references to a Pelosi tweet from May 2017, in which she stated “Our election was hijacked. There is no question.”

Loudermilk said he believes the so-called “cancel culture” is only going to intensify in the wake of last month’s riot in Washington, D.C. In doing so, however, he said he believes the Democratic opposition may be at risk of “overreach.”

Barry Loudermilk is a passionate representative of the people, who fights daily to ensure our children have a nation that is free, safe and full of opportunity. Barry believes that the best days for America are ahead of us, but only if we return to the basic values of hard work, honesty, individual liberty and respect for each other.

Barry believes that our government is one “of the people, by the people, and for the people” – not a people who serve the government. Our government was designed to be small in size, limited in scope, and its primary role is to protect the rights endowed to us by God.

“Because the cancel culture wants to use anything that we say, we do or the way we act as a method of shutting us down, and they are actively trying to do that,” he said. “The Democrats are baiting our side to do whatever we can that they can use as a diversion.”

“What happened in this election were entities that were not the state legislatures that were changing the election law,” he said. “Our objection was based on the secretary of state changed election law and he is not a member of the legislature, so it was unconstitutionally changed … we had six states that an entity other than the legislatures changed their election law.”

Loudermilk said he was curious as to why the AJC didn’t publish similar screeds when Democratic officials objected to the electoral college results in 2005.

“We don’t need to be going out there saying ‘Antifa caused this,’ because we don’t know,” he said. “There’s radicals on all sides of the political spectrum, we need to wait and see.”

Even now, Loudermilk said he believes Democrats refuse to denounce acts of violence perpetrated during the 2020 incidents — and for purely political reasons.

“If I say there’s evidence of fraud, then I am committing an act of insurrection against our nation and some have said I should be tried as a traitor and executed,” Loudermilk said. “If you say ‘Donald Trump did not incite that riot,’ then you’re committing an act of insurrection against this nation.’”

At one point, Loudermilk claimed United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “wants us to act like them,” alleging there is a “huge double standard in this nation.”

“I’m seeing guys in tactical gear, helmets, kneepads and body armor walking through, down the halls of the Capitol, in the rotunda,” he recollected. “This is not going very well.”

From his perspective, Loudermilk said he believes the Jan. 6 riots are merely a “continuation” of the violent demonstrations that took place last year in the wake of the police-involved death of George Floyd. “It’s just the Democrats are outraged now because it was where they were,” he said. “When you look at the violence that happened in Portland, Oregon, Seattle, Washington, in Minneapolis, in Wisconsin, in Chicago, in Atlanta, what was the cost, monetarily, in damage, destruction and lives as compared to what happened in the Capitol?”

Loudermilk said he also believes mainstream and national media has painted Republicans as “racists, bigots and insurrectionists,” among other pejoratives. He brought up an article published by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution shortly after the Capitol was stormed, in which the publication’s editorial board listed himself as among “those whose irresponsible words helped nurture this insurrection.”

He compared and contrasted the national media’s reaction to Democratic claims of “hijacked elections” in 2016 and Republican allegations of the same thing in 2020.

“Some of the folks that were there came and visited with us the day before, people that we know and some of you probably know them from Cherokee County, they were up there for the rally,” he said. “Their plan was to come and stand around the Capitol, as do groups all the time, most of them are usually far-left groups … just to show the strength and support that Trump still had in the nation.”

The demonstration, however, quickly devolved into chaos. Loudermilk recounted watching rioters attempt to storm the floors of the U.S. Capitol last month.

Still, that didn’t stop Loudermilk from alleging that members of the leftist organization were indeed present at the Jan. 6 riots.

 <tag> p


For the first time in a very long time, Americans are more optimistic about their financial situation. People are happier and more optimistic about their future, and they once again can believe the best days of America are ahead of us.



Life is the ultimate right endowed by God, and it is the responsibility of a government to protect that right. Barry believes, and science has proven, that life begins in the mother’s womb and it is our responsibility to protect the life of our most vulnerable, our unborn children.

As are most Americans, Barry has been horrified by the acts of evil perpetrated recently, especially on our children at school.

In the past year, Barry voted to repeal the Obamacare individual mandate – which forced Americans to buy health insurance plans that were prescribed by the government. As a result, Americans will no longer be forced by law to purchase policies they can’t afford and don’t provide the coverage they need.

Barry takes his oath of office very seriously and, while we must address the issue of violence in this nation, we have to focus on the actual source of the violence which, in every case, is the perpetrator of the crime, not the weapon they choose.

Barry believes that our government is one of the people, by the people, and for the people – not a people who serve the government. Our government was designed to be small in size, limited in scope, and its primary role is to protect the rights endowed to us by God. Over the past several years, our federal government has grown in both size and scope, and is now intruding in basically every aspect of our lives. This rampant growth in federal government has weakened our state and local governments, and the cost of this massive government is unsustainable – and is what has led to a $21 trillion debt. That’s why Barry has been a persistent advocate for individual liberty, personal responsibility and government accountability at all levels.

Barry believes that there shouldn’t be two standards in America, one for the regular citizen and another for those in government. Working with the White House, and other members of Congress, Barry has been at the forefront of reigning in the overgrown federal government, exposing corruption, and holding government bureaucrats accountable.

In 1798, Thomas Jefferson wrote, “I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government; I mean an additional article taking from the Federal Government the power of borrowing.”

Our vast freedom is due to generations of Americans who have answered the call to duty and served our nation in the Armed Forces.

When Congress was negotiating the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Barry fought tirelessly to ensure tax cuts extended to Georgia’s individuals, families and businesses. Barry strongly advocated for cutting taxes for all Americans, especially those in low and middle incomes. He also worked to ensure young families with children, and those just starting out in the workforce, received tax cuts and higher deductions to help them succeed.

Barry believes that the strength of America’s economy is with Main Street, not Wall Street. As a small business owner for over 20 years, Barry knows firsthand the impact high taxes and over regulation has on starting and growing a business. That’s why Barry has worked with the administration to not only cut taxes on our small businesses, but to roll back duplicative, irrelevant and overly burdensome regulations. In just the past year, Congress and the administration have eliminated 22 regulations for every 1 new regulation.

Barry has consistently advocated that, before we can tackle the larger issue of illegal immigration, we first have to secure America’s borders and ports of entry. When serving on the House Homeland Security Committee, Barry traveled to our southern border to see first-hand how drug cartels, and human traffickers are exploiting our porous and open borders. Our vast borders are a hotbed of criminal activity and pose a real threat to our national security. That’s why Barry helped write legislation that will provide for more physical barriers along our borders, and increase the number of border patrol agents – to stop criminal activities and stop illegal crossing.

National Security in the 21st century also includes the cyber battlefield, as well as in space. With over 20 years in the information technology sector, Barry understands the unique battlefield of cyberspace and is working to protect our vital intelligence and national security infrastructure, and to provide our military with the resources and training to counter these cyber threats.

Just in the past couple of years, insurance premiums have dramatically increased and many health insurance providers have pulled out of the market. This is creating a health insurance crisis in many parts of the United States, and we are on the verge of another dramatic increase this fall.

He has been the victim of gun violence, and experienced firsthand the trauma of being shot at with a semi-automatic rifle. Barry has been through the horror of witnessing friends and colleagues struggling for their lives after being shot. Barry has also been through the terror of being shot at without the ability to protect himself or others, because of restrictive laws that prohibited him from having a weapon to defend himself.

While supporting advancements in alternative fuel technologies, Barry understands that petroleum products remain the lifeblood of America’s progress and economy. He believes we must continue to advance clean and responsible ways of harvesting this vast natural resource so we remain energy independent for future generations.

Within weeks of taking office, Barry was appointed to a special task force to combat terrorism and foreign fighter travel. Through his tireless work, this task force uncovered numerous areas of vulnerability in our fight against radical Islamist terrorism. Immediately, Barry and the other members of the task force, began addressing these problems including closing holes in the State Department’s Visa Waiver Program, which could be exploited by foreign fighters trying to enter the U.S. Within months, Congress and the President acted on these recommendations, and the reforms are now law.

Since serving in Congress, Barry worked to pass legislation that has once again enabled the United States to become the largest producer of oil in the world. Since passing legislation that repealed the forty year old ban on exporting oil from the United States, America quickly emerged as a major oil exporting nation – which has reduced the world’s dependency on oil from Middle Eastern nations. Since this repeal was signed into law, OPEC nations are no longer able to control the world oil markets by manipulating oil prices for political purposes.

As an Air Force veteran, Barry understands that peace comes only through effective diplomacy backed by a strong and effective military.

We live in a dangerous time, with rogue regimes that are rapidly developing nuclear weapons and terrorist organizations that are funded by foreign governments. Barry has voted to increase defense spending so our men and women in uniform will have the resources they need to defend our freedom. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guardsmen deserve state-of-the-art weapons and equipment necessary to do their jobs.

As an Air Force Veteran, Barry understands the challenges our veterans face getting health care, jobs and basic benefits. That’s why he has fought to put the Veterans Administration on a path of reform. Since serving in Congress, Barry and other veterans serving in Congress have worked together to bring needed change to the Veterans Administration.

As an elected representative of the people, Barry has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States; and the right to purchase and own a firearm is clearly specified as a right afforded to citizens of the United States.

True tax reform can only be achieved by innovative reforms that abolish the IRS and the current system of taxing wages, and replaces it with a simpler and equitable tax system such as the Simple Tax or the Fair Tax.

That’s why Barry has consistently fought to protect all innocent life – through legislation, and in voting to ban taxpayer dollars from being used for abortions.

In just over three years in Congress, Barry has aggressively taken on the task of cutting the scope and size of government and worked on reigning in excessive and wasteful spending. That’s why Citizens Against Government Waste named Barry a “Taxpayer Super Hero,” for his relentless efforts to cut wasteful spending.

https://news.yahoo.com/wapo-fact-checkers-slam-biden-1530364...

Barry has supported, and is continuing to push for, major reforms that will lower premiums and deductibles – by eliminating unreasonable federal mandates and restoring the regulation of health insurance back to the state and local level.

We must also ensure that when our men and women in uniform are in action, they can be confident that their families are cared for and have the resources they need at home. Barry has fought for and supported a well-deserved pay raise for the members of our military.

Barry also believes in America’s workforce, and that it is the hardworking men and women of this country who are the strength of our economy. He believes everyone should be held responsible for their actions, and those who have positions in the federal government shouldn’t be given special treatment or held to a different standard for misconduct or poor performance. That’s why Barry authored the MERIT Act, which would hold government employees accountable to the same laws and standards as the rest of America’s workforce.

The cost of health insurance and healthcare has skyrocketed and continues to climb because of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) which put Washington bureaucrats in control of deciding what is best for individuals and their families.

However, to effectively control illegal immigration, we must also end counterproductive policies such as catch and release which impairs our law enforcement from effectively stopping and deporting those who enter our nation illegally.

While there is still much work to do for our nation’s veterans, Barry remains committed to ensuring our veterans receive the best care and the most prompt service possible.

In the past year, Barry has helped to pass several legislative initiatives to provide better care to our veterans and improve the responsiveness of the Veterans Administration. The Veterans Affairs and Whistleblower Protection Act, which was signed into law by President Trump, reformed the VA by creating a streamlined process to remove, demote or suspend VA employees for misconduct or poor performance (including improper care of veterans). It also expanded the protection from retribution of whistleblowers, who are a critical factor in rooting out corruption and misconduct within the administration.

Barry believes the individual should be empowered to decide what is best for their own healthcare, not some bureaucrat in Washington. In his short time in Congress, Barry has voted numerous times to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a system that allows insurance providers to provide innovative and new health insurance plans that are affordable and meet the needs of each individual, while ensuring those with pre-existing conditions have access to affordable health insurance plans.

Barry also supports allowing individuals the right to choose how they pay for health care; whether through private insurance, concierge services, group plans or paying cash for services.

The Obama Administration’s IRS scandal testifies to how out of control the federal government has become. This abuse of power is perpetuated by a convoluted tax code that redistributes wealth and punishes individual achievement and places the full burden of funding the government on hardworking Americans.

Barry has also supported legislation to allow the VA to provide adult day health care, increase disability payments for service connected disabilities and provide additional funding, provide for a Veterans ID card for all who have served, and increased funding to bring the VA health records system up to date.

President John Quincy Adams stated, “The Declaration of Independence will tell you that the authors held for self-evident truth that the right to life is the first of the unalienable rights…”

The safety and security of the people of this country is a core responsibility of our government, which, Barry believes, includes protecting every citizen’s right to protect themselves and their family. Barry remains a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, and opposes measures to restrict the rights of law abiding citizens to purchase and carry firearms.

The majority of Americans agree, that reducing our deficit spending and reigning in our national debt must be a priority of Congress and the President

However, Barry believes there are measures we can take to stop these perpetrators before they can carry out their acts of violence. Recent tragedies have highlighted gaps in our system that must be addressed, such as ensuring that our law enforcement appropriately responds to leads of individuals who have made threats or may be prone to carry out acts of violence.

While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provided significant tax relief for millions of Americans and businesses and stimulated the sluggish economy, we must continue to fight for an innovative tax system; such as the Simple Tax or the Fair Tax, that doesn’t punish hard work and success.

American citizens, the government, and our military are growing evermore dependent on technology, and it is important that support systems that provide connectivity and information; such as our cellular phone network, the Internet, weather and GPS satellites are state-of-the-art and protected from disruption of service.

Our massive federal spending and monstrous debt is directly related to the rampant growth of the federal government. While defense of our nation is the primary role of the federal government, it is only a small fraction of government expenditures. To maintain the massive government growth and size of federal departments and agencies, Congress has continued to go deeper in debt.

Once we have secured our border, we must reform our immigration laws by ending chain migration, stopping visa lotteries, and ensure those who are here on temporary visas return to their home countries when their visas expire.

Trust in the federal government is at its lowest in the history of our country. Much of this is due to the way bureaucrats treat citizens who must deal with one of the numerous government agencies. Whether it’s the Veterans Administration, the IRS, or the Social Security Administration, most Americans are frustrated by the slow response, lack of respect, and inconsiderate treatment. That’s why Barry has authored a bill to establish a set of standards for all agencies – to ensure that when citizens have to deal with the government, they are given prompt and courteous customer service.

Barry has also worked with members of both the U.S. House and Senate to introduce a Balanced Budget Amendment requiring Congress to Balance the Federal Budget. The Loudermilk Balanced Budget Amendment (H.J. Res 29) requires Congress to balance the federal budget, limits spending to 18% of GDP, and rolls all federal revenues under Congressional control.

In 2017, Congress passed the largest tax cut for America in a generation, and Americans across the country are seeing the positive effects. Since passing this legislation, the economy has grown faster than was predicted and the job market has exceeded our available workforce.

Barry’s father, a World War II veteran and a construction worker, impressed upon his children the idea you can change things if you stand up for what is right. “If there is something you don’t like,” his father said, “you have two choices…do something to change the situation, or just accept the status quo and go on with your life, but never just complain.” These words of wisdom inspired Barry to public service, and they’re what drives him to work to change the culture in Washington, DC.

Within weeks of taking office, Barry was appointed to a special task force to combat terrorism and foreign fighter travel through the House Homeland Security Committee. Through his tireless work, the task force uncovered numerous areas of vulnerability in our fight against radical Islamist terrorism. Immediately, Barry and the other members of the task force began addressing these problems, which included closing loopholes in the State Department’s Visa Waiver Program, being exploited by foreign fighters trying to enter the U.S. Within months, Congress and the President acted on this and other recommendations, and these reforms are now law.

Barry Loudermilk served in the United States Air Force where he worked as a Communications Operations Specialist for command, control and intelligence operations. Barry served at duty stations in Texas, Hawaii and Alaska, and received numerous awards and decorations for exemplary service. Barry also received numerous awards and recognition for his service during the 1986 Philippine Crisis, the 1986 Air Raid on Libya, Operation Just Cause in Panama, Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm.

As a veteran, Barry understands the challenges our veterans face getting health care, jobs and basic benefits. Since serving in Congress, he has passionately fought to put the Veterans Administration on a path of reform. Barry is also active in bringing attention to the problems our returning combat veterans are facing with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other issues. Barry is a member of the American Legion, and serves Post 42 in Cartersville, Georgia.

Barry was also the founder and co-owner of Freedom Flight Center, an aviation training business in Rome, Georgia.

Barry is a member of his local American Legion post.

The families’ interests and hobbies include aviation, rock climbing, hiking, hunting, fishing and most any outdoor activity, as well as studying and teaching America’s rich heritage.

Barry Loudermilk is a dedicated husband, father and grandfather. He and his wife, Desiree, have been married since 1983. They first met in 1981, while both were serving in a church ministry helping underprivileged children. Barry and Desiree have three grown children, a daughter-in-law, a son-in-law, and four grandchildren.

In the short time Barry has been serving in Congress, he has been recognized as one of the most effective new members of Congress, working to change the culture in Washington D.C.

The Loudermilk family are active in the community and have volunteered in charitable and service organizations across the state.

Barry and Desiree believe in strong family bonds. For years, the entire family served in the Civil Air Patrol, where they trained and participated in search-and-rescue, disaster relief and other emergency services throughout the state of Georgia.

Barry Loudermilk is a passionate representative of the people, who fights daily to ensure our children have a nation that is free, safe and full of opportunity. Barry believes that the best days for America are ahead of us, but only if we return to the basic values of hard work, honesty, individual liberty and respect for each other.

Barry doesn’t just talk about the challenges of small business ownership, he faced them daily as the owner of two small businesses in Northwest Georgia. In 1995, Barry started an information technology business in Cartersville, Georgia. Through his 20 years of running this small company, Barry has extensive experience and knowledge of information technology and the importance of protecting our government and businesses from cyber threats.

Barry previously served on the Homeland Security Committee.

Barry believes in action, not just talk, when it comes to community service. As an officer in the Civil Air Patrol, the official auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, Barry is a highly trained emergency services officer. He served as a volunteer search-and-rescue team leader and has participated in numerous search-and-rescue and disaster relief missions.

In the short time Barry has been serving in Congress, he has been identified as one of the most effective in reforming the federal government. Barry has led investigations into government data breaches, fought for more transparency and accountability in government agencies, and worked to ensure Washington bureaucrats are held to the same laws and standards as any other American. That’s why he’s been named the “best of the next generation of freedom fighters.”

With a background in information technology and his experience in military intelligence, Barry has quickly become a leader in cybersecurity policy. As a member of the Financial Services Committee, Barry is working with both the technology and financial service sector to ensure our personal data is better protected. Through his work on the Science, Space and Technology Committee, Barry has led investigations into data breaches within the federal government and cyber-attacks by foreign governments.

As a member of the Committee on House Administration, Barry helped usher through legislation to provide harsher penalties for sexual harassment and to end the payment of settlements with taxpayer dollars, as well as working to ensure election integrity.

Citizens Against Government Waste named him a “Taxpayer Super Hero,” for his relentless fight to stop wasteful government spending.

Because of his experience and background, Barry serves on three House committees; Financial Services, the Select Committee on House Administration, and the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress.

Freedom Works named him “the best of the next generation of freedom fighters.”

In Congress, Barry continues to fight for our freedom. As a member of the Special Task Force for Combating Terrorism and Foreign Fighter Travel, Barry helped uncover and address vulnerabilities in our homeland security. As a member of this special task force, he traveled to the heart of terrorist activity to meet with foreign officials and counter-terrorism experts.

Faith, Family and Freedom are his core principles, as he has fought to cut taxes for hardworking Americans, reduce the size and scope of government, and to secure liberty for future generations.
