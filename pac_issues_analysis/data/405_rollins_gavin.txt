Says the communist country’s aggression must be stopped. Keystone Heights, Fla., May 29 – Republican Congressional candidate Gavin Rollins today praised the Trump Administration’s changes in China policy, saying a lack of aggressive action to stop the communist-led country’s takeover of Hong Kong could have the same results as the west’s failure to stop Hitler early on. “There were many opportunities in the 1930s to stop Hitler’s aggression,” said Rollins. “We allowed Germany to rearm, a direct violation of the Treaty of Versailles, hoping for the best.

I have been personally touched by the power of adoption. My sister and nephew, who are both adopted, are beautiful examples of what happens when people choose life. Through education and social programs at the state level, we can begin to curtail the use of abortions as a method of birth control.

I believe life begins at conception until natural death. For every one adoption in this country there are 80 abortions, many are provided by Planned Parenthood, which receives hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars every year. In Congress I will fight to defund Planned Parenthood, redirecting the money to state adoption agencies.

Gavin Rollins

 <tag> p


As a soldier in the Florida Army National Guard, Rollins worked his way up from Private First Class to Captain, where he responded to Hurricanes Irma and Dorian here at home, and served our nation overseas in the Global War on Terror. As the senior intelligence officer in a combat zone in East Africa for Task Force Hurricane, he supported counterterrorism operations and defended US embassies, including during Operation Oaken Steel in South Sudan.

As an entrepreneur, Rollins has made startup investments in local businesses to create jobs; and as a conservative county commissioner, he has fought for Second Amendment rights, religious liberty, term limits for politicians, lower taxes, and practical innovations to reduce the size and improve the responsiveness of government.
