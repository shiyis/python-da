“If you never forget that we are all in this together, that we are always stronger together, and if we are united as one, there is no challenge we cannot meet, no obstacle we cannot overcome, no destiny we cannot fulfill and if you believe in that, I promise that we are going to build the Hawaiʻi that we have always talked about but have never been able to fully achieve and through the greatest gift Hawaiʻi has to offer, ALOHA, we are going to march this State and Country forward to a better and a brighter day.”

My ʻohana and I are deeply honored and extremely humbled that the people of Hawai‘i have elected me to represent our Second Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. I look forward to bringing leadership with aloha to our nation’s capital and cannot wait to hit the ground running. Because of your support, we were able to share our vision from Hilo to Hanalei, and we are ready for the work that lies ahead. Let’s do this — together!
