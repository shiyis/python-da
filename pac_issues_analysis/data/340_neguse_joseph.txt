“As the son of immigrants to this country who were given a shot at the American dream, I decided to run for office because that dream is under assault now as never before. I'm honored to represent the 2nd District in Congress and fight for the values we share - because now is the time.”

-- Joe Neguse, U.S. Representative, Colorado's 2nd Congressional District

 <tag> p


In Congress, Joe has worked tirelessly to serve the people of Colorado and work collaboratively to solve the most complex challenges of our time. In early 2019, he was recognized nationally for hosting the most town-halls of any freshman lawmaker in the U.S. —receiving the “Spirit of Service” award for a successful Service Town Hall initiative that combined constituent services with volunteerism — and in 2020 was recognized by the Lugar Institute as the most bipartisan member of Colorado’s House delegation. He introduced 38 bills in the 116th Congress — the most of any freshman member — and had four of his bills signed into law (the most of any member of Colorado’s delegation).

First, after graduating from the University of Colorado at Boulder summa cum laude, Joe co-founded New Era Colorado, the state’s largest youth voter registration and mobilization non-profit in Colorado. The organization, which has been featured in the New York Times and Time Magazine, has since registered over 150,000 young people to vote across the state, secured successful passage of progressive legislation at the state level (including online voter registration and 16/17 year-old voter preregistration), and has led the fight locally against climate change.

Then, following his term as a Regent, Joe was appointed at the age of 31 to lead the state’s consumer protection agency, making him one of the youngest people to serve in a state-Cabinet across the country. He led the department—an agency with roughly 600 employees and a $90 million budget—for two years, leading the fight to expand economic opportunities by protecting the civil rights of every Coloradan and strengthening consumer protections and safeguards. During his tenure the agency achieved key victories, including the recovery of millions of dollars for consumers, investigations culminating in significant financial-fraud cases, the championing of legislation to combat financial fraud against seniors, and launch of the state’s first online filing system for civil rights discrimination complaints. In recognition of his work to expand the agency’s consumer protection mission, Joe was awarded the 2017 “Consumer Protection Award” by the international Council on Licensure, Enforcement and Regulation.

Later, while still in law school at CU, Joe was elected in 2008 by the voters of the 2nd Congressional District to serve on the CU Board of Regents, becoming only the second African-American to be elected Regent in Colorado’s history. Joe served a six-year term on the Board (which oversees the CU-System, the fourth largest employer in the state with an operating budget of $3.4 billion), including two-years as Chair of the Audit Committee. As a Regent, Joe fought to make higher education more affordable and accessible and to build consensus on tough issues, sponsoring several resolutions that received bi-partisan and unanimous support, including efforts to lower student health insurance costs and make voter registration more accessible to students, as well as working to increase wages for the University’s lowest-paid workers.

Joe was elected in 2018 to represent the 2nd District in the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming the first and only African-American elected to serve in Congress in Colorado history. He is the youngest member of Colorado’s congressional delegation, and serves as a Vice-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a Vice-Chair of the Medicare-for-All Caucus, and was elected by his peers to be the Freshman Co-Representative to Leadership. In that capacity, he serves as a member of the House Democratic Leadership.

Prior to being elected to Congress, Joe served as an attorney, civic leader, and public official who spent his career fighting to expand opportunities for families across our state. Joe and his wife Andrea (who grew up in Broomfield) consider themselves incredibly lucky to call the beautiful City of Lafayette home, where they are raising their daughter Natalie and enjoy running on Boulder County’s amazing trails with their dog Teddy (a pug-Aussie mix). Joe has lived in the 2nd Congressional District for over 18 years, and was honored to represent the people of the 2nd district as an elected member of CU’s Board of Regents from 2009 through 2015.

Nearly 40 years ago, Joe’s parents fled Eritrea, a war-torn country in East-Africa, and immigrated to the United States as refugees, eventually settling in Colorado, where he and his sister were raised. As hardworking immigrants and naturalized citizens, Joe’s parents never forgot nor took for granted the freedom and opportunities the United States gave them and their children. Their experience motivated Joe to be an active participant in our democracy at an early age, and to give back through public service.

As a 36-year-old son of refugees from Africa, Joe is not your typical Congressman. But his family’s story, and deeply held belief that we need people from all walks of life to speak up and engage in our democracy, motivated him to run for office and fight for Colorado values in Washington D.C.

Joe’s public service is rooted in his firm belief that we should be expanding—not restricting—opportunities for all Coloradans, and he has spent his career doing the same. The opportunity to immigrate to our incredible country and pursue the American dream; to attend college, and participate in our economy; and ultimately, to shape our democracy. Joe’s belief that all Coloradans are entitled to these opportunities, shaped by his parent’s journey and experience, has been a guiding principle in his life, and he is honored to fight for these opportunities each and every day in the United States Congress.

 <tag> p


Joe’s parents immigrated to the United States from a war-torn country in East-Africa, drawn here by America’s promise and the opportunity to live the American Dream. But that dream is under assault now as never before.

Put simply, Joe is honored to serve as part of a new generation of leaders who are pushing for bold solutions to our most pressing problems, and not accept the status quo. As our Congressman, he is a passionate advocate for protecting our rights and fights each and every day for the people of the 2nd Congressional District.

Before being elected, Joe pledged that he’d be present in the community, just as he’s been all his career — and since being sworn in, holding frequent town-halls has been a true cornerstone of his service. He was recognized nationally in early 2019 for hosting the most town-halls of any freshman lawmaker in the United States, and launched a successful Service Town Hall initiative that combines constituent services with volunteerism and was awarded the “Spirit of Service” award for his efforts.

In Congress, Joe is leading the charge to reclaim that dream for countless Americans – by pushing back against the Trump Administration and fighting for real change in Washington D.C. He was elected by his peers to serve in House Leadership, and serves on three committees: the Judiciary Committee (where he serves as the Vice-Chair of the Antitrust Subcommittee), the Natural Resources Committee, and the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. He also serves as Co-Chair of the Congressional Refugee Caucus and as a Vice-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

Joe has introduced 30 bills in the 116th Congress — the most of any freshman member — and has already seen four of his public lands and school funding bills signed into law (the most of any member of Colorado’s congressional delegation). Each and every day in the U.S. House, he is working to expand opportunities for all Coloradans and protect our fundamental rights as Americans, including:

About Joe

The right to enjoy our treasured public lands, which means fighting against privatization and oil-and-gas development efforts on Federal public lands and championing efforts to protect open space in our district. Earlier this year, Joe shepherded his public lands package — the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act (CORE Act) — which became the first major Colorado wilderness legislation to pass the U.S. House in nearly a decade.

The right for every student to obtain a quality education at a public school. During the House appropriations process, Joe successfully worked with his colleagues to secure millions of dollars in increased funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and he continues to fight for increasing teacher pay, federal Title I funding for low-income students and federal Title II funding for teacher training, and holding Betsy Devos’ Department of Education accountable.

The right to breathe clean air and drink clean water. As the only Colorado lawmaker appointed by the Speaker of the House to serve on the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, and one of the first lawmakers in the country to support the Green New Deal, Joe has been a champion for combatting climate change. The very first bill he introduced is a proposal to expand solar energy (the Solar Edge Act), and he’s introduced and sponsored multiple bills to significantly increase investments in renewable energy and drastically reduce our carbon emissions. He also successfully secured millions of dollars during the House appropriations process to support the incredible Federal research labs across the 2nd District.

The right to be safe from violence in our communities, by fighting in the House for sensible gun-control measures, such as universal background checks and closing the Federal “gun show loophole,” supporting an assault-weapons ban, encouraging states to pass “Red Flag” laws which prevent people at risk to themselves or others from having access to firearms, and by opposing concealed-carry “reciprocity” legislation;

The right to participate in our economy, by co-sponsoring fair wage policies such as the Paycheck Fairness Act, co-sponsoring the Raise the Wage legislation to increase the minimum wage to $15 that recently passed the U.S. House, sponsoring measures to ensure that every public higher education graduate finishes debt-free, and protecting internet freedom by reinstituting net neutrality;

The right to not be discriminated against because of who you are, where you’re from, or whom you love, which means protecting women’s reproductive rights, including being an original co-sponsor of the EACH Woman Act of 2017 (which protects a woman’s right to choose), helping lead the effort in the House for the Dream and Promise Act of 2019, and serving as an original co-sponsor of the Equality Act to protect all Americans from discrimination;

The right to participate in our democracy, which means serving as one of the original co-sponsors of HR-1, which would overturn the disastrous Citizens United decision, and enact public financing of our elections and Automatic Voter Registration. In the House, Joe successfully secured a bi-partisan amendment to HR-1 that would enact pre-registration for 16 and 17-year-olds, and he continues to fight for reforms to the dysfunctional Federal Election Commission and protections of our sacred right to vote; and
