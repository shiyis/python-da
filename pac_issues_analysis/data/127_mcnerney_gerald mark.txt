Our region needs strong leadership in Washington to fight for resources to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and get our country back on its feet. Right now, workers and small business owners are struggling and in need of federal relief. That is why I have advocated and voted for ongoing support, including extending critical unemployment benefits and financial resources for small businesses during this pandemic. Additionally, too many Americans lack access to the internet, and there is now a greater urgency than ever to close the digital divide. I have fought for and introduced legislation to expand broadband access – so that our students can engage in distance learning, and individuals can telework, obtain telehealth care and access other critical services to participate in everyday life. My time in Congress has been dedicated to fighting for our community – particularly our veterans and the Delta – the lifeblood of our region. I am proud to have secured funding for the new VA clinic now under construction in San Joaquin County, and just as I fought against the tunnels, I will keep pushing to build a sustainable water future for Californians. Every day that I serve the people of California’s 9th Congressional District is a privilege. I will continue delivering results that strengthen our local economy, keep our children safe and healthy, protect Medicare and Social Security, and ensure a clean environment for future generations.

MEET JERRY

 <tag> p




Jerry was inspired to run for Congress by his son Michael, who in response to the attacks of September 11th, sought and received a commission in the Air Force. Michael suggested that his Dad serve his country by running for Congress. With a deep sense of duty and his family’s support, Jerry began his journey to Congress. Jerry is honored to serve on the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the oldest standing legislative committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. The committee is vested with broad jurisdiction on a number of issues including telecommunications, consumer protection, food and drug safety, public health research, environmental quality, energy policy, and interstate and foreign commerce. He is also proud to be a member of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Jerry, who has his Ph.D. in mathematics, served several years as an engineering contractor to Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico. In 1990 McNerney moved with his family to California, accepting a senior engineering position with U.S. Windpower, Kenetech. McNerney later began working as an energy consultant for PG&E, FloWind, the Electric Power Research Institute, and other utility companies. Prior to his election to Congress, he formed a start-up company to manufacture wind turbines. During his career in wind energy, McNerney’s work contributed to saving the equivalent of approximately 30 million barrels of oil, or 8.3 million tons of carbon dioxide. McNerney and Mary, his wife of 40 years, have three grown children. Their oldest son, Michael, is a reserve officer in the U.S. Air Force and a graduate of American University with a degree in law. Daughter Windy received a Ph.D. from Notre Dame in neuroscience and is now working on the biochemistry of neurodegenerative disorders as a fellow at the VA Palo Alto, and she also teaches at Stanford University. Their youngest son, Greg, received his Ph.D. in biophysics and is working as an engineer at Intel Corporation.

Jerry was sworn into office on January 4, 2007. He is proud to represent California’s 9th District, which includes a large portion of San Joaquin County in the Central Valley as well as parts of Contra Costa and Sacramento Counties.
