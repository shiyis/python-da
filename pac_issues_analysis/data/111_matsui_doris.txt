Reliable, accessible public transportation and ensuring our region has the infrastructure needed to grow and ensure residents’ safety are among my top priorities in Congress. We must continue to make much needed investments in our transportation infrastructure in order to boost our economy, create jobs, and plan for the future.

I continue to address our region’s transportation needs and collaborate closely with Federal, State, and local agencies to secure much-needed funds and approvals to move Sacramento’s transportation projects forward. Whether it is procuring federal grant dollars to build a new bridge connecting both sides of the river, expanding light-rail to Cosumnes River College and beyond, or bringing together local entities to explore a potential streetcar system, I am committed to improving Sacramento’s transportation infrastructure so that it remains a great place to live, work, and raise a family.

Matsui for Congress P.O. Box 1738 Sacramento, CA 95812 Sacramento4Doris@gmail.com

Technology is rapidly changing and always evolving. As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, and as co-chair of the High Tech Caucus, I am working to address the pressing technology issues of today – and tomorrow.

One of the biggest technology issues of our time is the issue of net neutrality. I have heard from hundreds of Sacramento residents who are concerned about the future of the Internet. I strongly support net neutrality. A free and open Internet is essential for consumers and to encourage innovation in our country. I introduced legislation that would ban paid prioritization agreements, or so-called Internet fast lanes. Our country cannot afford ‘pay-for-play’ schemes that divide our Internet into tiers based on who has the deepest pockets. The Internet has always been governed by fair competition and consumer choices online. This is essential to the growth of our economy and the health of our democracy.

Access to the Internet is essential in today’s world, and I believe that in order to remain competitive everyone must have access to the tools needed to innovate and succeed. I have introduced legislation to help close the digital divide, increasing access and affordability of Internet services for all. I have also introduced several bipartisan bills to help our nation meet its future spectrum demand, ensuring next generation technologies can be developed and used by consumers.

Matsui for Congress P.O. Box 1738 Sacramento, CA 95812 Sacramento4Doris@gmail.com

Those who work hard and play by the rules deserve a dignified and secure retirement. I am committed to improving the health and well-being of our aging population. In Congress I serve as the co-chair of the Congressional Task Force on Seniors, where I lead efforts to protect and strengthen Medicare and Social Security for seniors in Sacramento and the rest of the nation. I have also advocated for reforming our systems so that all Americans can achieve retirement security. I will continue working to make sure that our aging population can gain the fiscal and social stability they deserve and have worked so hard to acquire.

I also believe that while we must strengthen the economy, we must also ensure our economy works for everyone. I am pleased that California raised the minimum wage, and I strongly support raising the national minimum wage to $10.10/ hour.

Matsui for Congress P.O. Box 1738 Sacramento, CA 95812 Sacramento4Doris@gmail.com

With the large role women play in today’s workforce, the success of our economy relies on the economic security of women. That is why I joined my colleagues in launching “When Women Succeed, America Succeeds: An Economic Agenda for Women and Families.” This Economic Agenda includes legislation enabling women to achieve greater economic security, raising wages for women and their families, and allowing working parents to support and care for their families. From legislation ensuring equal pay for equal work to paid sick leave to protections for pregnant workers, I strongly support legislation that will help women succeed, because when women succeed, America succeeds.

Rebuilding our economy and putting our region’s residents back to work remains my number one priority. Over the last several years, we have seen some progress, but there is much more to be done. In light of state and local budget cuts, ensuring the federal government is responsive to our region’s needs has never been more important. I will continue supporting legislation that will create jobs and move our economy forward by investing in the growing industries of health care, clean energy, and technology. This will not only make our economy stronger today, but make our future brighter tomorrow.

I have worked closely with our region’s health care and safety net providers to ensure that residents understands their health care options, and have access to the health care they need. As the result of our hard work, local clinics and health care providers have received millions in federal grants and reimbursements under the ACA to expand access to care and provide more services. I will continue fighting to preserve the ACA and its protections for consumers, so that all hard working American families can benefit from and access affordable health care.

Matsui for Congress P.O. Box 1738 Sacramento, CA 95812 Sacramento4Doris@gmail.com

I am also a long-time supporter and advocate for improving our nation’s mental health care. Too often mental health takes a back seat to the issue of physical health. It is time for mental health to be treated on a level playing field with the rest of our nation’s health care system. I am thrilled that in 2014 Congress passed and President Obama signed into law a demonstration project based on my bipartisan legislation, the Excellence in Mental Health Act. The passage of this bill represents a $1 billion investment by Congress to improve and expand the mental health safety net. This is a huge step, and I will continue to fight in Congress to ensure that we build on this achievement and further expand access to mental health services.

Tremendous efforts have been made to ensure all Americans have access to affordable, quality health care. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) not only opened up access to health insurance for millions of Americans, it also improved the quality of insurance, providing new consumer protections and cost savings.

Our region is blessed to sit at the confluence of two great rivers – the American River and the Sacramento River. These rivers bring many opportunities, but they also make us one of the highest risks of flooding in the country. Flood protection remains one of my top priorities, as it is key to the safety and economic vitality of our region. I am working every day to see that our flood protection priorities get the federal attention and funding they require, and to ensure that flood insurance rates remain affordable for all Sacramento residents. We must finish the new spillway at Folsom Dam, improve the American and Sacramento River’s Levees, and complete the South Sacramento Steams Group Project.

In 2014 our region saw an important victory for our flood protection goals. Legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama included language I authored authorizing the Natomas Levee Improvement Project. Natomas’ levees protect more than 100,000 Sacramento residents and billions of dollars of property and infrastructure. This important authorization will allow work to continue on strengthening these levees, making sure they are secure for years to come.

I am firm believer in the power of education, and making substantial improvements to our nation’s education system must be a top priority.

Finally and importantly, we must invest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education today in order to produce the innovators and inventors of tomorrow. As co-chair of the Congressional High-Tech Caucus, I continue to advocate for all students to have equal access to STEM education. I have hosted a number of STEM panels at our local high schools, bringing together students and professionals in these fields, to help students get excited about the possibilities. I want to make sure that not only is our nation producing the STEM leaders of tomorrow, but that they are coming from the Sacramento region.

Matsui for Congress P.O. Box 1738 Sacramento, CA 95812 Sacramento4Doris@gmail.com

We must improve the No Child Left Behind Act and the Education and Secondary School Act so that every child in the region and the rest of the nation has access to equal and excellent education.We also must make changes to ensure higher education is affordable and accessible for every child in America. The unfortunate reality is that skyrocketing college costs are putting a college education out of reach for many families. To help address this, I have supported legislation that prevented student loan interest rates from doubling, and locked in rates for new student loans to prevent rates from skyrocketing in the future.

This is a good step, but further action must be taken. Nearly 40 million Americans are struggling to repay student loans, putting off goals such as home ownership and saving for retirement. I support legislation that would allow student loan borrowers to refinance their loans at more affordable rates, saving them thousands of dollars.

Clean energy is a growing industry in the Sacramento region, filled with both promise and potential. As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, I have made it a top priority to bring clean energy technology to Sacramento, and to support companies who aim to create good-paying, clean-tech jobs to our region. I have introduced legislation to support our local clean-tech businesses while also reducing our dependency on foreign oil. As a result, the Sacramento region has been transforming into a clean energy hub, with more than 450 companies and a growing number of other companies flocking to the region. Energy efficiency must continue playing a large role in our energy future. From world-class universities and facilities, to cutting-edge companies, and forward-thinking utilities, Sacramento has been leading the way. I will continue working to make our region the clean-tech capitol.
