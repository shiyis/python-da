Alan Cohn is the former anchor / managing editor of ABC 7 News at 7 p.m., which takes an in-depth, investigative look at hot issues of the day. Cohn is the recipient of the 2007 George Foster Peabody Award, one of journalism’s highest honors, for uncovering that defective parts were being installed on Black Hawk helicopters built by Stratford-based Sikorsky Aircraft.

Cohn is a graduate of Hofstra University and a 2011 graduate of the FBI Citizens Academy where he joined other select community leaders in Tampa in participating in courses involving terrorism, espionage, white-collar crime, and cyber crime. Alan and his wife Patricia live in Tampa, FL. and have two children Ann and Aaron.

For over 30-years, Alan has been speaking truth to power. Whether it’s taking on corporations making defective equipment for the military, exposing criminals, and corrupt politicians, crusading for consumer rights, and standing up for veterans, Alan Cohn earned the reputation as one of the most respected and investigative reporters in the nation. As Chief Investigative Reporter at WFTS-TV in Tampa, he exposed a fake U.S. Marine masquerading as a decorated war hero in Tampa.

Along the way Cohn has worked for ABC News, reported for NBC News and worked five years at CBS News in New York where he helped cover the 1980 and 1984 Presidential elections. He was the 2014 Democratic nominee for Congress in Florida’s 15th Congressional District. Endorsed by Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and described by Creative Loafing as “An impressive candidate all around,” and “The best Democrat to run for this seat in over a decade.”

In his eight years at WTNH-TV, Alan not only won the Peabody Award, he uncovered a ring of DMV employees selling drivers licenses illegally on the black market resulting in a state wide scandal and criminal convictions.

While at New England Cable News in Boston, Alan received a Page 1 byline in the Boston Globe for uncovering a brutal police beating and he earned an Emmy Award after discovering a convicted killer trying to become a Boston police officer. In Miami, Alan earned an Emmy Award for winning back benefits for a lost and forgotten Vietnam veteran.

Alan exposed a political candidate who took a half million dollars from a wealthy businessman to buy a undisclosed vacation home. Alan also caught a local man who was passing himself off as a recipient of the Navy Cross despite never serving in the military, which resulted in a federal conviction of violating the stolen valor act.

Alan Cohn is an investigative journalist who has spent three decades taking on powerful people and corporations, exposing corruption, and uncovering the truth. His wide-ranging enterprise reporting has exposed police brutality coverups, environmental scandals, and corrupt politicians abusing their power.

He’s running for Congress, because climate change is an existential threat that threatens our planet and taking bold, urgent action is the only way we can mitigate the worst effects of this crisis.

Alan Cohn helps a Vietnam Vet get 30 years of benefits that the VA was denying him.

Alan Cohn exposes a con artist who lied about being a marine

The countless stories he’s reported, include a three-year investigation, where he uncovered a defense contractor installing defective parts on Black Hawk Helicopters and putting the lives of troops at risk. It includes a South Florida Water Management System facility that was allegedly burying barrels of Agent Orange underground. He crawled on his hands and knees under a fence to trespass into the facility and get a soil sample.

He’s running for Congress, because healthcare is a human right and we need to make sure every person in this country has access to affordable healthcare, but we have a broken healthcare system, where too many Americans don’t have health insurance and the ones that do can’t afford their monthly premiums and sky high deductibles.

And years ago, he found a homeless Vietnam Vet with PTSD eating out of a trash can and being denied benefits from the Veterans Administration. He reported on the man’s story, tracked down his commanding officer to prove he was in combat, and helped get him $60k in back pay along with a $2000 monthly benefit check. Alan also caught a fake U.S. Marine masquerading as a decorated war hero despite never serving in the military, which resulted in a federal conviction of violating the stolen valor act.

In one of Tampa’s biggest political scandals, he exposed a State Senator who took a half million dollars from a wealthy businessman to buy an undisclosed vacation home.

He’s running for Congress, because we have got to address the threat of Coronavirus head on and provide economic relief to families and small businesses who are affected by it. We’re in the middle of a global pandemic that has killed over 140k people and caused millions to lose their jobs. It threatens further economic destruction and massive loss of life if we do not take immediate action to contain the virus.

He’s running for Congress, because prescription drug costs are out of control and people deserve to get the medications they need for a fair price.

Below are a few of the biggest stories Alan broke as an investigative journalist:

For Alan, investigative journalism was a way to make a positive impact on society by holding powerful people, corporations, and politicians accountable and shining light on their behavior when they hurt the public good. He’s running for Congress, because he believes exposing the wrongdoing of political leaders and massive corporations was no longer enough; he had to get in the fight himself and make the policy changes that working people in our country need.
