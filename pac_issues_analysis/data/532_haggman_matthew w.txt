MATT’S POLITICAL BELIEFS

We are living in perilous yet EXCITING times! What a combination! Government growth, debt, and spending are the largest threats to our economy, our safety, our liberty and our pursuit of happiness. Our only remedy is to reduce the size and scope of government, remove bureaucratic obstacles to economic growth and to force our government to perform MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY on the revenue it currently collects. Without taxing us more!
