Communism? Really?

#VoteForLiz

*Even though Republicans do not vote on identity politics, Liz is extremely proud of her heritage and is excited to build on the legacy of her ancestors.

Yes! Liz didn't think it was possible either.

That was until she spent more time really getting to see "how the sausage was made." It's not obvious at first, but whenever you find yourself wondering Why aren't things better off for more of us? You will start to see that there is a process behind it all.

We are living in an amazing time in our country's history. More people have the ability to make a positive impact, but for some reason, not enough know the power they really have.

(More information like top issues, events, and live polls will be added over the next couple of weeks. Thank you for your patience!)

PAID FOR BY LIZ MATORY FOR CONGRESS CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE

Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.

P.O. 393

This campaign is about encouraging more Americans to step into their full citizenship. Educate one another. Encourage one another. Know what is at stake. Know that you can take back your power. If more of us do not WAKE UP and protect our republic, it will most certainly be lost.

As the strongest citizens ever created in the history of history, we cannot continue to allow communism to take over our nation.
