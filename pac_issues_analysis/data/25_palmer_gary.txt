The problem with Obamacare is not the website or the rollout. The problem with Obamacare is what it’s trying to impose upon the American people.

Like so many other addiction issues, the first step for Congress to take in fixing the debt problem is to admit that they have a spending problem.

Mr. Palmer, who grew up in Hackleburg, a small town in Northwest Alabama, now lives in Hoover and represents Alabama’s 6th Congressional District. Mr. Palmer graduated from the University of Alabama and was the first person on either side of his family to attend college.

H.R. 5931, the Prohibiting Future Ransom Payments to Iran Act

PELHAM

U.S. Iran Claims Tribunal

CLAY— Citizens of Clay welcomed Alabama 6th District U.S. Congressman Gary Palmer Monday night when he hosted a Town Hall meeting at City Hall. The meeting was an opportunity for Palmer to update the community on the issues being faced by Congress and to give audience members a chance to ask questions and voice concerns.

By MICHAEL J. BROOKS / For the Reporter

Winning by big margins in traditionally GOP areas, Trump easily carried the state’s nine electoral votes over Clinton, and other races and issues also were being decided. The ballot included four U.S. House seats, plus a U.S. Senate race, and voters were to decide 14 statewide amendments.

With 208 of 305 District 6 precincts reporting, Palmer is the projected winner of his race with 77 percent of the votes, which equaled 164,709 votes. His Democratic challenger David Putman received 23 percent of the votes, which equaled 48,218.

“My attitude is that my job is to represent the 6th District, not be an absentee representative, so I come home every weekend. I work in the district when I’m home, I’ve been in every county multiple times and I’m doing what I can to help,” Palmer said.

Republican U.S. Rep. Gary Palmer has won his first re-election campaign in the 6th District of central Alabama.

Incumbent Senator Richard Shelby secured his sixth term for the U.S. Senate, winning 64.2 percent of the votes against Democrat Ron Crumpton.

It’s campaign season, but Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Hoover, is not necessarily in campaign mode. The freshman congressman is letting his record and policy positions do the talking instead of stump speeches.

Donald Trump thrusted the state into the spotlight when he invited Senator Jeff Sessions on stage during his victory speech Wednesday morning.

While the presidential election is what got most of the media coverage on Tuesday, Alabamians cast their votes in a number of other races. The down-ballot results followed the historical pattern, with the majority of those elected being Republican.

The 82-year-old senator was first elected as Democrat in 1986, but switched to the GOP in 1994. He faced no significant opposition in 2004 and 2006, as right-leaning scorecards ranked him as one of the most conservative members of the U.S. Senate.

PELHAM – As U.S. Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Vestavia Hills, stood in a room full on engineers on Tuesday, Nov. 1, he shared with them that he used worked at a manufacturing plant at night earning less than $6 per hour to help pay his way through school.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday to prohibit future cash payments to Iran until the nation stops sponsoring terrorism and is no longer involved in money laundering. H.R. 5931, the Prohibiting Future Ransom Payments to Iran Act also requires 30-day Congressional notification and review of any future settlements related to the U.S. Iran Claims Tribunal.

Congressman Gary Palmer is creating a documentary film series for Alabama Congressional District 6, which includes Chilton County. Palmer recounted how he was raised in a small town without a traffic light, and how this contributed to his affinity for small towns. The goal of the project is to tell the story of the counties the Congressman represents and draw visitors and businesses to small towns. “We want to drop in interesting things that will make people say ‘I’d like to drive down there,” said Palmer.

BIRMINGHAM — Alabama voters turned out in big numbers to pick Republican Donald Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton for president, and they also decided a host of other offices and issues.

Palmer, whose suburban Birmingham district is among the most conservative in one of the reddest states in the country, told AL.com that his visibility in the seven counties he represents and his reputation for being more interested in policy than politics will be rewarded on Tuesday.

“I applaud the amazing work of the patriotic men and women at the Department of Justice in making these two terrorists answer for their crimes,” Palmer said.

The Trump administration’s decision not to repeat the mistakes of the past

On Tuesday, Shelby easily defeated Democratic challenger Ron Crumpton. Crumpton is best known in the state as an advocate for legalizing medicinal marijuana.

The event was the first of seven which will take place in October throughout the area and which Palmer hopes will maintain the relationship between himself and local communities. “When I ran for Congress, one of the things I wanted to do was to not be an absentee member of Congress for you,” Palmer said. “I have a real soft place in my heart for rural communities.”

“Physically, that was the hardest job that I think I’ve ever had,” he said. “When I got home after that first night I think I just laid out on the floor and passed out.”

PELHAM – U.S. Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama’s 6th Congressional District said America is on a breakneck course to bankruptcy, and pledged to do all he could to stop wasteful government spending.

Smart people learn from their mistakes, but wise people learn from other people’s mistakes. That is why you study history.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WIAT) — President-elect Donald Trump’s win is still setting in for some. CBS42 wanted to dig deeper into what a Trump Presidency could look like and what it would mean for Alabama.

“We must get our fiscal house in order,” he said. “We have unaccountable government expenditures and unaccountable government receipts.”

People stood in lines for around an hour in some voting places Tuesday as predictions of a strong turnout driven by a rough-and-tumble fight for the White House appeared to be on target. Few problems were reported statewide.

Palmer also was a founding member of the board of directors of the State Policy Network, an umbrella organization for various state-based think-tanks. He served on the State Policy Network board for six years, the last two as chairman. Leading this broad coalition of policy thinkers gave Palmer exposure and knowledge of policy problems that confront all 50 states. When State Policy Network was founded in 1992, there were fewer than 20 state think-tanks in their network. Today, State Policy Network has 65 member organizations.

After earning a B.S. in Operations Management, he worked in the private sector for 12 years, including nine with two major engineering construction companies, before involvement with Focus on the Family lead him to start the Alabama Family Alliance which later became the Alabama Policy Institute.

He also serves on the Budget Committee and the Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Palmer is a member of the Republican Study Committee and it’s Steering Committee.
