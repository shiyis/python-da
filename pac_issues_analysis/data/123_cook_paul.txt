Continuing his lifetime commitment to service, Paul distinguished himself in the California State Assembly by fighting government corruption, reducing taxes, and increasing penalties on sex offenders who prey on children. During his time in Congress, he helped rebuild a military weakened by eight years of bad policy, championed the largest tax cut in a generation, and authored a landmark bill on public lands in the desert.

His commitment to law and order, reducing government, and lowering taxes have helped protect working families throughout California, and he has been a tireless advocate for veterans and military families.

As Supervisor, Paul will be a leader with the courage to stand on principle and fight for our values.

The 1st District in San Bernardino County deserves a Supervisor with courage and conviction. An infantry officer who served with distinction in the United States Marine Corps and a veteran of the Vietnam War, retired Colonel Paul Cook’s military career spanned twenty-six years. His actions in combat earned him a number of honors, including two Purple Hearts and the Bronze Star Medal with Valor Device.

Colonel Paul Cook, USMC (ret.) announced today his campaign for San Bernardino County Supervisor in District 1. “Serving in Congress has been an absolute honor, and I’m proud of my numerous victories amid a tough partisan atmosphere. Our high desert needs continued strong leadership at the county level, and I pledge to fight for this area with the same dedication and conviction I’ve demonstrated my entire career.”

For a brighter future in San Bernardino County, we need to create more good paying middle-class jobs. As California’s urban counties become more expensive places for residents and businesses alike, we can position San Bernardino County as a place of opportunity and entrepreneurship. I’ll work to make our county an attractive place for jobs and businesses, cutting red tape and making it easier to achieve the American dream.

Earlier this year a presidential candidate made headlines when he declared he was coming for our guns. But here in California, our state government has for decades led an attack on law-abiding gun owners. Big-city politicians have armed security for themselves, but they want to deny High Desert residents that same security in their own homes. As your County Supervisor, I’ll fight to protect legal gun owners against any state or federal government that would threaten them.

Our roads and other infrastructure has been neglected for too long. As Supervisor, I’ll work aggressively to find funding for vital transportation projects. Most importantly, I’ll be your voice to demand our fair share of state and federal infrastructure dollars. For too long, Los Angeles and other big cities have stolen our transportation dollars to fund their own bloated projects. As your County Supervisor, I’ll fight to ensure that San Bernardino County taxpayers receive their fair share of transportation funding.

San Bernardino County is the largest county in the lower 48 states, and the 1st Supervisorial District is the largest in the County. Local residents, not politicians from LA and San Francisco, should have the strongest voice in how this land is utilized and managed. As your County Supervisor, I’ll oppose efforts by the state and federal governments to dictate land usage, and I’ll fight to make sure public lands are open for public use.

Educating our young people is one of the most important responsibilities in a community. Unfortunately, every year, we see shocking new mandates coming out of Sacramento, adding new and controversial topics to local school curriculums. I believe neither Washington nor Sacramento should dictate education, and local communities, led by parents and teachers, know best how to educate our children. As your County Supervisor, I’ll be a champion for students, parents, and teachers locally.

As County Supervisor, public safety will be my top priority. I’ll oppose efforts by Sacramento to dump state prisoners into our county jails, and I’ll fight hard against the early release policies that put criminals back on our streets. I’ll stand with law enforcement to help ensure they have access to the latest technology to identify and apprehend the criminals that prey on our community.

I’ve been one of the strongest opponents to California’s dangerous sanctuary state law. As your County Supervisor, I’ll fight to ensure that our local law enforcement is able to work with federal authorities to remove dangerous criminals from our community. San Bernardino County should join other local governments in opposing Sacramento’s unconstitutional interference in federal immigration enforcement, and, if elected, I’ll make sure the County stands for the rule of law.

Californians already have one of the highest tax burdens in the country and, once again, Sacramento politicians are trying to weaken Proposition 13’s protections for homeowners. I fought to keep taxes low while representing you in Washington and helped pass the largest federal tax cut in a generation. As your County Supervisor, I’ll fight any efforts to undermine Prop 13, and I’ll work to lower taxes and fees for High Desert residents.

In 2012, Paul’s neighbors elected him to represent them in Congress. As a Congressman, Paul distinguished himself as a champion for lower taxes, a strong military, veterans, and public access to public lands.

After retirement from the Marine Corps, Paul served in local government and demonstrated his commitment to policies that protected working families and law abiding citizens.

Paul is a member of the Disabled American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and American Legion. Paul and his wife Jeanne reside in Apple Valley.

Holding a lifelong commitment to education, Paul has taught history and political science at Copper Mountain College, California State University San Bernardino (CSUSB), and University of California, Riverside (UCR). Paul holds a master’s in political science from UCR and a master’s in public administration from CSUSB.

An infantry officer who served with distinction in the United States Marine Corps and a veteran of the Vietnam War, Paul’s military career spanned twenty-six years. His actions in combat earned him a number of honors, including two Purple Hearts and the Bronze Star Medal with Valor Device. Paul retired from the Marine Corps as a colonel.

San Bernardino County is a place of opportunity and possibility. Yet, we’re under attack from California’s bad policies and dangerous laws. We need a Supervisor with the courage and conviction to stand up for us. Retired US Marine Corps Colonel Paul Cook’s service and sacrifice to our country make him uniquely qualified to serve as our next supervisor in San Bernardino County’s 1st District.
