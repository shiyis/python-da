I’m excited to continue my work on behalf of the hardworking folks of the 7th district. Since being first elected to Congress, I have worked hard to improve the quality of life for hardworking Coloradans. My priority is making sure everyone has a good job, can afford to send their kids to college and have enough left over for retirement.

"Ed Perlmutter fights for what we value. In Jeffco, he stood side by side with parents and community members to keep our public schools public and out of the hands of the Koch brothers. In Washington, he works with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find common ground and fresh approaches to solve complex problems. He's also a tireless champion for equal rights. His leadership gets results that benefit us all."

Colorado and the 7th Congressional District is home to one of the most vibrant and fastest growing senior populations in the country. We need to stay committed to finding smart, practical ways to protect Social Security and to provide our seniors with the support they deserve.

We’ve made a promise to our senior citizens, and that’s a promise I’m committed to keep. Congress needs to not only maintain Social Security, but we need to strengthen and secure it for future generations when they retire. Privatizing Social Security is not the way to do it.

My top priority is keeping our communities safe from COVID-19 and helping our economy recover from this pandemic by safely getting people back to work. To begin with we must all do our part by wearing a mask, washing our hands, and social distancing from others. We need a national plan...

We must also find a permanent solution for young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children so they can remain here legally. I am strongly opposed to recent changes to the DACA program and I support several legislative proposals in Congress including the DREAM Act and the American Hope Act to provide certainty for these young people. Pursuing commonsense, comprehensive immigration reform will ensure we can continue to grow our economy and make America a place of opportunity for everyone.

The Trump Administration’s plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is unnecessary and will do nothing to address our broken immigration system. We have to get serious about implementing comprehensive immigration reform which includes the following steps:

A quality education is the foundation for a bright future for our children. This is possible if local communities have the resources they need to provide the highest quality education possible for our children.

My three daughters and my wife’s three children are all products of Jefferson County Public Schools, my wife Nancy is a retired teacher from Pomona High School in Arvada, and my sister Cassie is a Denver Public School teacher. Public schools provided my family and me the tools we needed to succeed in life. I believe every child deserves this same opportunity, and I will continue to pursue these goals.

Providing the best education possible for our children means parents, teachers and communities working together toward the same goal. The value of a family’s investment in our children’s education cannot be overstated, and we should encourage parents to be actively involved in their children’s education. We also need to make sure our teachers have the tools, resources and support they need to provide our children with a solid, well-rounded education. Fortunately, in Jefferson County, we have seen the community stand up to and vote against radical school board members and their extremist agenda.

Higher education is a critical component of our ability to remain globally competitive. Skyrocketing costs are making it harder, not easier, for students to receive a higher education. We need to make sure the costs of higher education are not unreasonable by increasing the level of available Pell grants and minimizing the costs of student loans. I will continue supporting proposals to keep student loan interest rates low and making higher education more affordable and accessible for everyone.

Equality also means equal pay for equal work. Raising the minimum wage and ensuring both men and women receive equal pay is a critical issue for many of today’s hardworking middle class families. I’m proud to have voted for both the Paycheck Fairness Act (which adds additional protections to the Equal Pay Act of 1963) and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (which works to close the gap between men’s and women’s wages).

I am proud to be part of a country with a diverse population and so many hardworking families looking to achieve the American Dream. We must ensure we can all succeed in America in order to create a strong, secure and stable future for generations to come.

The value and success of our country is due in large part to the diversity of our citizens. I believe we should never discriminate against someone based on gender, race, creed, religion or sexual orientation.

That’s why I support a Constitutional Amendment to reign in money in elections and set reasonable limits on how much can be raised and spent by candidates and organizations. I also support increased transparency in political spending. We deserve to know the true sponsor of political ads, and I support a law requiring those who pay to influence voters are publicly disclosed. I also believe public companies should report their political activities to shareholders because their investors deserve to know what political ads they’re buying with their money.

The Citizens United decision is the most significant blow to our democracy in recent history. You don’t have to turn on a television during election time to understand our campaigns and elections have been overrun by corporate interests. It’s high time we got our elections back on track.

One of the greatest achievements of Dodd-Frank was the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an independent agency that is focused exclusively on protecting consumers from bad actors in the financial services sector. The Trump administration has threatened to dismantle this agency which I oppose and will continue to fight against.

At the end of 2008, our country faced a financial crisis like we hadn’t seen since the Great Depression. As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, I worked diligently to secure passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Our country cannot afford another financial crash, and while not perfect, I’m proud to have worked on this historic legislation.

For years Wall Street and many large investment institutions were not held accountable for their actions. This brought our country to its worst financial downturn since the Great Depression.

Not only does our aerospace industry contribute to Colorado’s economy, but it also enables us to push the current boundaries of technology, innovation, and exploration. My number one aerospace priority is to achieve a long-term plan and funding for NASA to send humans to Mars by 2033. We need an all-hands-on-deck approach to make that happen. We’ll need to create things we’ve only dreamed of, and that kind of innovation will create good-paying jobs, enhance our economy, and nurture the forward-looking spirit we have as Americans.

I’m working to advance our aerospace priorities because they’re vital to Colorado’s aerospace economy and to humanity’s exploration of space.

In addition to health care, we have a responsibility to help put our Veterans back to work or help them receive an education when they return home. I am committed to making sure our Veterans and all Americans have the ability to obtain good jobs and the training necessary to sustain those jobs. I voted for updates to the post-9/11 GI Bill to expand and simplify educational opportunities to ensure our veterans more access to the education they need. Additionally, I supported a measure to extend the home buyer tax credit for any active duty military personnel who served overseas for more than 90 days to help them with the opportunity to purchase their first home.

This means ensuring transparency and accountability at all VA facilities to ensure Veterans’ health does not suffer. We need to make it easier for our local VA facilities to attract and hire new doctors, nurses, and support staff. As we discuss the future of VA healthcare, I want to ensure we enhance care at the VA and not take away from it or privatize care.

That’s also why I have been fighting for the new VA medical facility in Aurora. The project was plagued by a contract dispute and severe mismanagement, but today the project is back on track and this state of the art medical facility is slated to open in 2018 to serve Veterans across the Rocky Mountain region.

As the father of a daughter with epilepsy, finding ways to ensure access to quality, affordable health care is one of my top priorities. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has helped millions of Americans and thousands of Coloradans gain access to quality healthcare coverage. Most importantly, the ACA ensures individuals with pre-existing conditions can no longer be discriminated against and kids can remain on their parents’ plan until the age of 26.

PAID FOR BY PERLMUTTER FOR CONGRESS

Health care is an issue that touches many people in different ways, and we have to ensure the ACA works effectively and keeps health care affordable so more people can get the kind of quality care they deserve. I will work with anyone to improve the ACA and I will continue to fight against attempts to repeal or replace it.

Additionally, I will continue to support stem cell research because this research provides the greatest promise we have to find a cure for medical conditions such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes. I feel it is our responsibility to invest in research that could save millions of lives. Nearly everybody has a family member, a friend or colleague who could benefit from stem cell research.

I also believe medical decisions should be between women, families and medical professionals. Government should not be involved in a woman’s reproductive health decisions.

 <tag> p




Since taking office, my priority has been to make sure the folks in the 7th Congressional District have good jobs so everyone can afford to pay their mortgages, send their kids to college and have enough left over for retirement. Washington D.C. is where I work, but Colorado is my home. I fly back and forth every week so I can make sure I regularly meet with constituents.

Currently, I live in Arvada with my wife, Nancy, a retired public school teacher. Our blended family includes six grown children and three spouses: Alexis and her husband Matt, Abby and her husband Jonny, Zoe and her husband Pete, David, Jane, Matt and his wife Clare. We also have three grandchildren, Finn, Lily, and Beatrice.

Hi, I’m Ed Perlmutter, Congressman for the 7th Congressional District. I am a lifelong resident of Jefferson County and can usually be found at the grocery store down the street, on the bike path, or the local coffee shop. As an active member of our community, I believe it’s important to be accessible and listen to the people I represent.

I am a product of Colorado’s public schools – I graduated from Jefferson High School in Edgewater and the University of Colorado in Boulder for both college and law school. I worked as a laborer on construction projects during the summers in college and law school, and then practiced business law with a local law firm for 25 years. In 1994, I was elected to the Colorado State Senate where my priority was to improve the quality of life for hardworking Coloradans.

In 2006, I was elected to represent the 7th Congressional District which includes Adams and Jefferson Counties. In Congress, I’ve tried to work hard to get things done for Colorado – like fighting to make sure good jobs remain at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, protecting thousands of workers who are building the Orion Space Vehicle in Jefferson County, or ensuring the new VA Medical Center opened to serve our Veterans, from Montana to New Mexico, and their families. My ability to work across the aisle has earned me a spot as one of the most bipartisan members of Congress and of Colorado’s congressional delegation, according to Georgetown University’s Bipartisan Index.
