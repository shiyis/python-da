Delivering for the Inland Empire

Building A Stronger Middle Class

Inland Empire families deserve a leader who will work across the aisle to deliver the results they deserve. As a fourth generation San Bernardino County resident, I understand the struggles of families throughout our community. As your current Representative in Congress, I’m working to fix these problems to improve the lives of families like yours and mine.

Improving Public Education

I am running for re-election because I know how to bring Democrats and Republicans together to confront issues facing our community. I’ve worked with members of both parties on legislation to expand protections and job opportunities for veterans, cut taxes and red tape for small businesses, make health care more affordable and fix our broken immigration system.

I’m proud to have a 100% lifetime rating from Planned Parenthood and will continue to stand up for women’s reproductive rights.

And I’ve been on the front lines fighting to close the gender pay gap, end wage discrimination, improve the quality of care women veterans receive at the VA, and eliminate workplace discrimination against pregnant women.

Women’s reproductive rights are under constant attack and we’re still a long way away from realizing full pay equity for women. In Congress, I’ve been standing up to the Trump Administration’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood and restrict access to abortions, contraceptives and family planning services.

We need to support the brave men and women who defend our country when they return home. In Congress, I helped hundreds of Inland Empire veterans get access to the benefits they’ve earned and my annual Veteran Resource Fairs have connected hundreds local veterans to critical housing, health care and employment opportunities here in San Bernardino County.

Earlier this year, I led the effort in Congress to pass a law that would ensure that military service members can use their skills from the military to quickly transition to good-paying jobs here in the Inland Empire when they return home and I helped secure over $500,000 to help homeless veterans in San Bernardino County.

I’m committed to protecting Social Security and cosponsored legislation affirming that Social Security should be preserved, protected and expanded. My annual Senior Fairs have connected hundreds of Inland Empire seniors with vital resources in our community and I will continue advocating for policies that reaffirm our promise that all Americans can retire with the dignity and respect they deserve.

Medicare and Social Security are vital to the health and welfare of older Americans in San Bernardino County and throughout our nation. I have fought Republican efforts to turn Medicare into a voucher program, which would force seniors to shop for health insurance on the private market and pay thousands more in out-of-pocket expenses for the same level of coverage.

We need an immigration policy that builds bridges, not walls and keeps families together instead of tearing them apart.

Both parties need to come together to pass comprehensive immigration reform that keeps families together, provides a pathway to citizenship, protects people who were brought to the United States as children from deportation, while also protecting the border and our national security.

Earlier this year, I led Democratic negotiations in the House of Representatives on legislation to create a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers after President Trump ended the DACA program. My bipartisan legislation makes sensible security improvements along the southern border and allows Dreamers to remain in the only country they’ve ever called home.

Every American should have access to high-quality, affordable health care. That’s why I’ve been fighting back against the Trump Administration’s efforts to take health care away from millions of families and allow health insurance companies to call the shots.

Expanding Access and Lowering Cost

I am committed to expanding access to health care for all Americans and will continue fighting for policies that lower the cost of coverage for individuals and families.

I fought efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and I oppose any effort that would allow insurance companies to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions, raise rates, or cut millions off of their health care plans. I also fought against the Republican tax plan that gives 83 percent of the tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations while gutting Medicare and Medicaid and increasing insurance premiums for the middle class.

I take the effects of climate change and pollution very seriously and have worked in Congress to reduce our carbon footprint and prioritize the health and safety of our communities.



A Sound Approach to Energy and the Environment

I am firmly committed to strengthening our clean air and water standards, promoting investments in clean energy technology and taking assertive actions to reduce carbon emissions and combat global climate change.

I am proud to have the support of the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club as I fight back against the Trump Administration’s attempts to weaken our environmental standards.

Improving Public Education

As a product of public schools and the father of two young boys attending public schools, I know first-hand that a quality education is vital to our future.

I’m proud to have earned the support of the California Teachers Association for my commitment to improving our public education system, expanding access to vocational programs and fighting to make college more affordable.

PAID FOR BY PETE AGUILAR FOR CONGRESS

With the help of a federal Pell Grant, I worked my way through college. that’s why I believe every student who works hard should be able to afford a college education. Last year, I wrote a bill to help ease the student loan burden on students and their families, and I’ve been fighting back against Republican efforts to cut Pell Grants, on which so many Inland Empire students rely.

Building A Stronger Middle Class

Earlier this year, I stood up to Republican efforts to give a massive tax cut to the wealthy while leaving middle-class families to foot the bill. My annual Inland Empire Jobs Fairs have helped over one hundred people find jobs and as our region’s economy continues to recover from the Great Recession, growing the Inland Empire economy and helping workers find good-paying jobs will continue to be my top priority in Congress.

I am committed to giving hardworking people in our community the opportunity to succeed and achieve their dreams.

PAID FOR BY PETE AGUILAR FOR CONGRESS

In Congress, I’ve been working to expand job training opportunities so that students are job-ready out of high school and fighting to reduce the cost of college so that more students can afford it. Last year, I wrote a bill to give small businesses a tax break for the cost of training new employees and I helped secure funding to retrain laid off Ashley furniture employees when their Colton facility closed and the jobs were outsourced overseas.

Pete works across party lines to bring people together and delivers results that help Inland Empire residents succeed. From delivering resources to support small businesses, schools and frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic to investing in affordable housing.

Pete Aguilar represents California’s 31st Congressional District in San Bernardino County. Elected to Congress in 2014, Pete was one of only three Democratic candidates nationally to flip their seat from red-to-blue. Prior to being elected to Congress, Pete served as the Mayor of Redlands.

Pete grew up in a working-class family in San Bernardino. His dad was a union worker for a local utility company and his first job was working with his grandfather bussing tables at the San Bernardino County Courthouse. He worked two jobs through college and proudly graduated with the help of Pell Grants.

Inland Empire families deserve a leader who will work across the aisle to deliver the results they deserve. As a fourth generation San Bernardino County resident, I understand the struggles of families throughout our community.

Now as the Vice Chair of the House Democratic Caucus, Pete is giving his community a voice in Congressional Leadership.

In Congress, Pete fights every day to rebuild the middle class, create good-paying jobs in communities like the Inland Empire, reform our broken immigration system and provide resources to our seniors, veterans and students. Pete is also focused on modernizing our national security by investing in cyber defense and leading Congress in the effort to ramp up cyber security training and job creation. He wants to modernize our national security, which is why he is leading an effort to stop white supremacists and other extremists from infiltrating our military and introduced legislation to help the federal government prepare for and prevent domestic terror incidents.
