Maria Elvira Salazar has spent a lifetime exposing the corrupt elites. As a journalist, she went toe-to-toe with Fidel Castro and called out Nicolás Maduro. She spent three years covering a war zone in El Salvador. Her parents fled Cuba with just five dollars in their pocket. She grew up in a tiny apartment in Little Havana and later in Puerto Rico. She’s always spoken out for freedom and defended people against all forms of oppression and racism—including defending Latinos and Jewish Americans. In Congress, she’s fighting to stop socialism from ever coming and ruining America.
